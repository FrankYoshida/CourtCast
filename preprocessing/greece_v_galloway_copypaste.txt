Galloway. Mr. Hungar.ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERMR. HUNGAR: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:The court of appeals correctly held that the legislative prayers at issue in this case were not offensive in the way identified as problematic in Marsh, but the court then committed legal error by engraftingthe endorsement test onto Marsh practice of legislative prayer. JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr.as a new barrier to theOfficial - Subject to ReviewHungar, I'm wondering what you would think of the following: Suppose that aswe began this session of the Court, the Chief Justice had called a minister up to the front of the courtroom, facing the lawyers, maybe the parties, maybe the spectators. And the minister had asked everyone to stand and to bow their heads in prayer and the minister said the following: He said, we acknowledge the saving sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross. We drawAlderson Reporting Company3

You who will raise us in our turn and put us by His side. The members of the Court who had stood responded amen, made the sign of the cross, and the Chief Justice then called your case.Would that be permissible?MR. HUNGAR: I don't think so, Your Honor. And, obviously, this case doesn't present that question because what we have here is a case of legislative prayer in the Marsh doctrine, which recognizes that the history of this country from its very foundations and founding, recognize the propriety of legislative prayer of the type that was conducted here.JUSTICE GINSBURG: Well, the question -­JUSTICE KAGAN: The extension just between the legislature and any other official proceeding; is that correct?MR. HUNGAR: Well, clearly, Marsh involves legislative prayer, the tradition that we rely on involves legislative prayer, and this case involves legislative prayer. Whether -- what rule might apply in other contexts would depend on the context.JUSTICE KAGAN: Suppose I ask the exact same question, same kinds of statements, same sort of context, except it's not in a courtroom. Instead, it'sOfficial - Subject to ReviewAlderson Reporting Company

Maybe it's a confirmation hearing, maybe it's an investigatory hearing of some kind, and that a person is sitting at a table in front of the members of a committee, ready to testify, ready to give his testimony in support of his nomination. The minister says the exact same thing.MR. HUNGAR: I think that's a -- that's a closer question because of the congressional history, but, of course, at least as far as I'm aware, they have this history as it applies to the legislative body as a whole, not to committees, but it would be a different question. One, obviously, important distinguishing factor there, in addition to the fact that it's not the legislative body as a whole -­JUSTICE SCALIA: We should -- we should -­MR.

HUNGAR: That's correct, Your Honor. That's why we believe this case is actually an easier case than Marsh because in Marsh, there was a paid chaplain from the same denomination for 16 years.JUSTICE GINSBURG: But the question, Mr. Hungar -­Official - Subject to ReviewJUSTICE KAGAN: Suppose you are correct, Mr. 11 years the prayers sounded almost like the ones that I read, and one year onHungar, for exclusively four occasions, there was some attempts to vary it up, to have a Baha'i minister or a -- a Wiccan, but for the most part, not out of any malice or anything like that, but because this is what the people in this community knew and were familiar with and what most of the ministers were, most of the prayers sounded like this.MR. HUNGAR: Well, no. I mean, it's clearly not correct that most of the prayers sounded like the one you just read.JUSTICE GINSBURG: But your position is that wouldn't matter, as I understand, because you have -­ you have -- you have two limitations, proselytizing and disparaging.

One couldread your brief and say, well, it doesn't matter; it could be an executive body, it could be a court, it could be a town meeting, a school board, a zoning board, a utilities board. That's -- is this case about prayer at the beginning of a legislative session or is it about prayer in all three branches of government?MR. HUNGAR: This case is about prayer at the beginning of a legislative session. That's exactly what the meetings at issue here are -- are about. That's what the board of the Town of Greece is. In fact, Respondents try to argue that this is somehow what they call coercive because there are public hearings that are held. But the public hearings are held at least 30 minutes after the prayer and anyone coming for the purpose of the public hearing can easily show up after the prayer if they don't want to be there.JUSTICE KENNEDY: Why -- why was it that you answered Justice Kagan's question to the this would be a violation?

Legislatures can be partisan, the judiciary should not be.

If the hypothetical is as you described with a different minister, with -- with an open process, a nondiscriminatory process like the one we have here, I think it would be a much closer case than this one, but it might be constitutional. But whether that case is constitutional or not, this case is far from the constitutional line, further from the constitutional line than the State legislature's practice in Marsh. Because there, Nebraska had one chaplain from one denomination for 16 years and yet, that was constitutionally permissible, and his prayers were not distinguishable in content from the prayers at issue here during the time that was relevant to the case.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Would it make a difference in your analysis if instead of, as Iunderstand the hypothetical, there was a point of saying, all rise or something of that sort?

Is that a -- is that a ground of distinction that you're willing to accept or not?MR. HUNGAR: I don't think that is constitutionally significant, unless -- I mean, it might be different if people are compelled to stand, but whether they are or not -- I mean, in the Marsh case itself, Senator Chambers testified that the practice in the Nebraska legislature was for people to stand and he felt coerced to stand. Because when he was there -- he tried to avoid it -- but when he was there, he felt he needed to stand because everybody else was doing it and he needed to have dealings with these people as a fellow legislator.The Court, nonetheless, held that he's an adult and he -- he is expected to be able to disagree with things that he disagrees with and that is not a constitutional violation.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: I wonder how far you can carry the -- your historical argument and whether some of these things are properly regarded as moreOfficial - Subject to ReviewAlderson Reporting Company10

It's been that for a long time, right?MR. HUNGAR: Yes, sir.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But wouldn't we look at it differently if there were -- suddenly if there were a proposal today for the first time, to say let's adopt a motto "In God we trust"? Would we view that the same way simply because it's -- in other words, the history doesn't make it clear that a particular practice is okay going on in the future. It means, well, this is what they've done -- they have done, so we're not going to go back and revisit it. Just like we're not going to go back and take the cross out of every city seal that's been there since, you know, 1800. But it doesn't mean that it would be okay to adopt a seal today that would have a cross in it, does it?MR. HUNGAR: Not necessarily. But -- but I think history is clearly important to the Establishment Clause analysis under this Court's precedence in two significant respects, both of which apply here, one of which might not apply in your -- with respect to your hypothetical.The first being the history shows us that the practice of legislative prayer, just like the motto,Official - Subject to ReviewAlderson Reporting Company11

And secondly, the history of legislative prayer, unlike your hypothetical, goes back to the very framing of the First Amendment. The fact that -- then this is what the Court said in Marsh -- the fact that at the very time the First Congress was writing and sending the -- the First Amendment out to the States to be ratified, they adopted the practice of having a congressional chaplain. And the congressional chaplain -- the record -- the historical record is clear -- gave prayers that were almost exclusively sectarian, as Respondents define that word.Official - Subject to ReviewJUSTICE SCALIA: I don't really your -- your answer.

And we believe that is an appropriate doctrine.JUSTICE GINSBURG: Is there -- is there any constitutional historical practice with respect to this hybrid body? It's not simply a legislature. It has a number of administrative functions. Sometimes it convenes as a town meeting. Sometimes it entertains zoning applications. Is there a history for that kind of hybrid body, as there is for the kind of legislature we had in Nebraska or our Congress?MR. HUNGAR: Yes, Your Honor, in two respects. First of all, the Becket Fund amicus brief identifies various examples of -- of municipal government prayer over the course of our founding, which is -- over the course of our history, which is not surprising given this -- the legislative practice at the State and Federal level as well.And secondly, Congress for much of its -- of much of our history entertained private bills, which would be the equivalent in terms of legislative orOfficial - Subject to ReviewAlderson Reporting Company

GERSHENGORN: So, Your Honor, you have to look at -- at the prayer to determine proselytizing.

But the kinds of debates that you're seeing among the parties, whether, for example, 15 percent, 50 percent, 60 percent of the congressional prayers are sectarian.

GERSHENGORN: So, Your Honor, I'd like to address the coercion point this way: With respect to town councils, it's our view that as a general matter that the municipal legislatures can invoke the same tradition of solemnizing and invoking divine guidance as Federal and State legislatures. We recognize there are differences, however, and Your Honor has pointed to one and that's the -- what was called the public forum here. And we think it's very -- because those are the ones where the -- is adjudicated license applications, liquor applications. And we do think it is important on this record that those are separated in time. It's at the court of appeals Appendix 929 and 1120. So that the meeting starts at 6:00, which is in the prayer -- when the prayer is, but the board meetings to adjudicate those types of issues are at 6:30 or 6:32.And so the type of concern that Your Honor has raised is not presented on this record and we think that's significant.

For another, inform the people in town of the tradition so they won't be confused.But you recognize on the one hand that this isn't like Congress or the Nebraska legislature, and then you say these would be nice things to do.

And to the extent that the town canpoint to things such as -- such as things like that, that is helpful. With respect to the --public criteria andOfficial - Subject to Reviewthe public forum aspect, I don't think we have a position as to whetherit is required, but we do think that that makes this case the much easier case, because of that separation of the one part that is the strongest argument for the other side, that there is an element of coercion, that your application is -- is being ruled on, that the separation the town has adopted makes that much less persuasive.We think the other elements that the Respondents have pointed to for coercion are ones that trouble us because they are things that have analogs in our history. So, for example, they point to the presence of children. But, of course, on the Senate floor are the Senate pages, who are all high school juniors. And as the reply brief points out, there are often children in the galleries at State legislatures being acknowledged. And so some of those -- thoseAlderson Reporting Company26

The testimony is most of the citizens bow -- most of the citizens bow their heads whether they are asked to or not. So people who are not participating are immediately visible. The pastors typically say: "Please join me in prayer." They offer the prayer on behalf of everyone there. They talk about "our Christian faith."JUSTICE SCALIA: This is coercion? He says, you know -- he says, "May we pray," and somebody doesn't want to pray, so he stays seated.MR. LAYCOCK: What's coercive about it is it is impossible not to participate without attracting attention to yourself, and moments later you stand up to ask for a group home for your Down syndrome child or for continued use of the public access channel or whatever your petition is, having just, so far as you can tell, irritated the people that you were trying to persuade.JUSTICE ALITO: Let me give you an example of a practice that's a little bit different. Maybe you'll say it's a lot different from what the Town of Greece does. First of all, this town starts out by making -- by proceeding in a more systematic and comprehensive way in recruiting chaplains for the monthOfficial - Subject to ReviewAlderson Reporting Company37
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 910 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25or whatever it is. So instead of just looking to all the houses of worship within the town, it identifies places of worship that may be outside the town boundaries that people within the town who adhere to a minority religion may attend.And it makes it clear that it's open to chaplains of any religious -- of any religion on a rotating basis. And then they have -- they structure their proceedings so that you have the prayer, and then the legislative part of the town meeting.And then there's a clear separation in time and access between that part of the proceeding and the hearing where variances and things of that nature are held.Now, you would still say that's unconstitutional because you have to add on that a prayer that is acceptable to everybody; is that it? Is there any other problem with what I've just outlined?MR. LAYCOCK: Well, if the separation in time really works, that's part of the remedy that we've suggested that is possible here. We still believe that prayers should be nonsectarian.JUSTICE GINSBURG: On the remedy, this case was remanded by the Second Circuit for the parties together with the court to work out appropriate relief.Official - Subject to ReviewAlderson Reporting Company38

LAYCOCK: Well, we think the town has to have a policy.CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, just to be clear, are you talking about what would be satisfactory to the Second Circuit or satisfactory to you?

And we think the town should do what it can to ameliorate coercion. It should tell the clergy: Don't ask people to physically participate. That's the most important thing.The government suggests disclaimers might help. We think that's right. The government suggests separating the prayer a bit more in time. Some States put their prayer before the call to order. The prayer could even be five minutes before the beginning of the meeting.The coercion can't be entirely eliminated, but the gratuitous coercion, the things that are done that don't have to be done in order to have a prayer could be eliminated. And we think those two pieces are the components of a remedy.JUSTICE SCALIA: Mr. Laycock, it seems to me that you're missing here is -- and this is whatdistinguishes legislative prayer from other kinds -- the people who are on the town board or the representatives who are in Congress, they're citizens.

And it seems to me that when they do that, so long as all groups are allowed to be in, there seems to me -- it seems to me an imposition upon them to -- to stifle the manner in which they -- they invoke their deity.MR. LAYCOCK: We haven't said they can't invoke the deity or have a prayer, and they cancertainly pray any way they want silently or just before the meeting. We've said they cannot impose sectarian prayer on the citizenry, and that is very different from what Congress does, it is very different from what this Court does. Maybe the closest analogy is legislative committee hearings where the citizens interact. We don't have a tradition of prayer there.What -- what -- what the town board is doing here is very different from anything in the traditionAlderson Reporting Company41

I mean, in my own opinion, I don't know of anyone else's, I'm not talking for others. But one -- a major purpose of the religion clauses is to allow people in this country of different religion, including those of no religion, to live harmoniously together.Now, given that about the problem of prayerbasic purpose, what do we doOfficial - Subject to Reviewin these kinds of legislative sessions? One possibility is say, you justcan't do it, it's secular. But that is not our tradition.MR. LAYCOCK: That's correct.JUSTICE BREYER: All right. The second possibility is the one that you are advocating. And it has much to recommend it, try to keep non-denominational, try to keep it as inoffensive to the others as possible. That's the upside.The downside is seeing supervised by a judge dozens of groups, and today, there are 60 or 70 groups of different religions coming in and saying, no, that doesn't work for us, this doesn't work for us, and that's the nightmare that they are afraid of.I mean, even in this town or in the area,Alderson Reporting Company42

So there's a third approach, andthat is say, well, you can't have them if there's any aspect of coercion. But we just saw people walking into this room, "God save the United States" and you want to win your case. I didn't see people sitting down.All right. Then the fourth approach, which is the other that has -- makes its appearance here, is to say let's try to be inclusive. Now, was enough -- in other words, so you didn't get the right prayer today, but you -- and even with the nonreligious, you know many believe in the better angels of our nature and the spiritual side of humankind; it's not impossible to appeal to them. So you say, you'll have your chance.And that's the thing I -- I would like you to explore. I mean, is there a way of doing that or is that preferable to the other ways or do we get into trouble?MR. LAYCOCK: We think that rotation does not work. First of all, because -- for several reasons, but most citizens come for a single issue to one or two meetings. They get the prayer they get that night. They don't benefit from the rotation scheme. Any rotation scheme will be dominated by the local majority,Official - Subject to ReviewAlderson Reporting Company

There are often political protests; there are often threats and hate mail. They don't want to give the prayer. And many city councils won't stand up to the political pressure and enable those people to give the prayer.So there are multiple reasons why rotation does not solve the problem here.We think nonsectarianism has a very long tradition. The government is not a competent judge of religious truth, Madison said, that was not a controversial proposition in the founding. And even in the first Congress, in the prayers they point to, there were no prayers there that violate our principle, invoking details in which believers disagree. Because then, 98-1/2 percent of the population was Protestant, Christ was not yet a point that disbelievers disagreed.JUSTICE ALITO: Well, that gets exactly to the -- that gets exactly to the problem with your argument about nonsectarian prayer. Yes, when -- at the beginning of the country, the population was 98 percent-plus Protestant. Then it became predominantly Christian.

LAYCOCK: Well, the test that we have proffered is the test from the McCreary dissent, points on which believers are known to disagree. So you don't have to be a theologian. Points on which people are commonly known to disagree, and the Fourth Circuit has had no difficulty administering this rule.

That's really the question, isn't it?MR. LAYCOCK: That's the issue that actually arises in the case.JUSTICE KAGAN: That's the issue that actually arises. Here's what -- I don't think that this is an easy question. I think it's hard, because of this. I think it's hard because the Court lays down these rules and everybody thinks that the Court is being hostile to religion and people get unhappy and angry and agitated in various kinds of ways. This goes back to what Justice Breyer suggested.Part of what we are trying to do here is to maintain a multi-religious society in a peaceful and harmonious way.

That would be sectarian and unconstitutional under Respondent's position.With respect to coercion, it's unquestionably true that there is less basis for claiming coercion here than there was in Marsh. In Marsh, Senator Chambers was required to be on the Senate floor by rule, he had to be there to do his job and the practice was to stand every single time, which he did because he felt coerced to do it; whereas, here, the record suggests that there were three times when somebody requested people to stand out of 121 occasions. The idea that this is more coercive than Marsh is absurd.In Marsh the Court expressly rejected a coercion argument saying, "We expect adults to be ableAlderson Reporting Company57

With respect to the history, as well, Ithink the debate in the Continental Congress, when this issue was first raised, shows what the American tradition has been. That is Americans are not bigots and we can stand to hear a prayer delivered in a legislative forum by someone whose views we do not agree with.

That can't possibly make a difference as an Establishment Clause matter. It makes no sense to suggest that a prayer at the local level is more dangerous for Establishment Clause purposes than what Congress is doing. Only Congress could establish a religion for the entire nation, which is the core preventive purpose of the Establishment Clause. To suggest that there are greater restrictions on municipalities makes no sense at all.We think that the dangerously overbroadtheories advanced by respondents history and traditions, which we of tolerance for religious views with in the legislative context.are at odds with our reflect this tradition that we don't agreeOfficial - Subject to ReviewAlderson Reporting Company58
