3                          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:    We'll hear argument  

4      first this morning in case 12-696, the Town of  

5      Greece v. Galloway.  

6                          Mr. Hungar.

8                               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER  

9                          MR. HUNGAR:    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,  

10      and may it please the Court:  

11                          The court of appeals correctly held that the  

12      legislative prayers at issue in this case were not  

13      offensive in the way identified as problematic in Marsh,  

14      but the court then committed legal error by engrafting  

15      the endorsement test onto Marsh as a new barrier to the  

16      practice of legislative prayer.  

17                          JUSTICE KAGAN:    Mr. Hungar, I'm wondering  

18      what you would think of the following:    Suppose that as  

19      we began this session of the Court, the Chief Justice  

20      had called a minister up to the front of the courtroom,  

21      facing the lawyers, maybe the parties, maybe the  

22      spectators.    And the minister had asked everyone to  

23      stand and to bow their heads in prayer and the minister  

24      said the following:    He said, we acknowledge the saving  

25      sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross.    We draw

1      strength from His resurrection.    Blessed are you who has  

2      raised up the Lord Jesus.    You who will raise us in our  

3      turn and put us by His side.    The members of the Court  

4      who had stood responded amen, made the sign of the  

5      cross, and the Chief Justice then called your case.  

6                          Would that be permissible?  

7                          MR. HUNGAR:    I don't think so, Your Honor.  

8      And, obviously, this case doesn't present that question  

9      because what we have here is a case of legislative  

10      prayer in the Marsh doctrine, which recognizes that the  

11      history of this country from its very foundations and  

12      founding, recognize the propriety of legislative prayer  

13      of the type that was conducted here.  

14                          JUSTICE GINSBURG:    Well, the question -­

15                          JUSTICE KAGAN:    The extension just between  

16      the legislature and any other official proceeding; is  

17      that correct?  

18                          MR. HUNGAR:    Well, clearly, Marsh involves  

19      legislative prayer, the tradition that we rely on  

20      involves legislative prayer, and this case involves  

21      legislative prayer.    Whether -- what rule might apply in  

22      other contexts would depend on the context.  

23                          JUSTICE KAGAN:    Suppose I ask the exact same  

24      question, same kinds of statements, same sort of  

25      context, except it's not in a courtroom.    Instead, it's

1      in a congressional hearing room.    Maybe it's a  

2      confirmation hearing, maybe it's an investigatory  

3      hearing of some kind, and that a person is sitting at a  

4      table in front of the members of a committee, ready to  

5      testify, ready to give his testimony in support of his  

6      nomination.    The minister says the exact same thing.  

7                          MR. HUNGAR:    I think that's a -- that's a  

8      closer question because of the congressional history,  

9      but, of course, at least as far as I'm aware, they have  

10      this history as it applies to the legislative body as a  

11      whole, not to committees, but it would be a different  

12      question.    One, obviously, important distinguishing  

13      factor there, in addition to the fact that it's not the  

14      legislative body as a whole -­

15                          JUSTICE SCALIA:    We should -- we should -­

16                          MR. HUNGAR:    -- is that people are compelled  

17      to attend and testify under oath, which is a different  

18      situation from the one here.  

19                          JUSTICE KAGAN:    Well, why -­

20                          JUSTICE SCALIA:    We should assume -- to, to  

21      make it parallel to what occurred here that the next day  

22      before the same committee a Muslim would lead the  

23      invocation and the day after that an orthodox Jew.    I  

24      mean -­

25                          MR. HUNGAR:    Yes, Your Honor.

1                          JUSTICE SCALIA:    -- it makes a difference  

2      whether it's just one -- one denomination that is being  

3      used as -- as chaplain or open to various denominations.  

4                          MR. HUNGAR:    That's correct, Your Honor.  

5      That's why we believe this case is actually an easier  

6      case than Marsh because in Marsh, there was a paid  

7      chaplain from the same denomination for 16 years.  

8                          JUSTICE GINSBURG:    But the question,  

9      Mr. Hungar -­

10                          JUSTICE KAGAN:    Suppose you are correct, Mr.  

11      Hungar, for 11 years the prayers sounded almost  

12      exclusively like the ones that I read, and one year on  

13      four occasions, there was some attempts to vary it up,  

14      to have a Baha'i minister or a -- a Wiccan, but for the  

15      most part, not out of any malice or anything like that,  

16      but because this is what the people in this community  

17      knew and were familiar with and what most of the  

18      ministers were, most of the prayers sounded like this.  

19                          MR. HUNGAR:    Well, no.    I mean, it's clearly  

20      not correct that most of the prayers sounded like the  

21      one you just read.  

22                          JUSTICE GINSBURG:    But your position is that  

23      wouldn't matter, as I understand, because you have -­

24      you have -- you have two limitations, proselytizing and  

25      disparaging.    And -- but I think Justice Kagan's

1      question just set place -- place limitations.    One could  

2      read your brief and say, well, it doesn't matter; it  

3      could be an executive body, it could be a court, it  

4      could be a town meeting, a school board, a zoning board,  

5      a utilities board.    That's -- is this case about prayer  

6      at the beginning of a legislative session or is it about  

7      prayer in all three branches of government?  

8                          MR. HUNGAR:    This case is about prayer at  

9      the beginning of a legislative session.    That's exactly  

10      what the meetings at issue here are -- are about.  

11      That's what the board of the Town of Greece is.    In  

12      fact, Respondents try to argue that this is somehow what  

13      they call coercive because there are public hearings  

14      that are held.    But the public hearings are held at  

15      least 30 minutes after the prayer and anyone coming for  

16      the purpose of the public hearing can easily show up  

17      after the prayer if they don't want to be there.  

18                          JUSTICE KENNEDY:    Why -- why was it that you  

19      so promptly answered Justice Kagan's question to the  

20      effect that this would be a violation?    What/why would  

21      there be a violation in the instance she put?  

22                          MR. HUNGAR:    I'm sorry.    Which instance,  

23      Your Honor?  

24                          JUSTICE KENNEDY:    The first question Justice  

25      Kagan asked you, the hypothetical about the prayer in

1      this Court.    You seemed readily to agree that that would  

2      be a First Amendment violation.    Why?  

3                          MR. HUNGAR:    Well, perhaps I conceded too  

4      much, but I think the important distinction is between  

5      the -- both the judicial context and the legislative  

6      context on the one hand and the -- the absence of a -­

7      of a comparable history that shows that it did not -­

8                          JUSTICE KENNEDY:    Well, is it -- is it  

9      simply history that makes -- there's no rational  

10      explanation?    It's just a historical aberration?  

11                          MR. HUNGAR:    No, it's not -- it's not a  

12      question of historical aberration.    It's a question  

13      of -­

14                          JUSTICE KENNEDY:    Well, what's -- what's the  

15      justification for the distinction?  

16                          MR. HUNGAR:    It's a question of what the  

17      Establishment Clause has understood, both at the time  

18      and throughout history, to forbid and not to forbid.  

19      The judiciary is different than a legislature.  

20      Legislatures can be partisan, the judiciary should not  

21      be.    People are compelled to testify under oath.  

22                          JUSTICE SCALIA:    But you -- but you -- you  

23      had no problem, Mr. Hungar, with the marshal's  

24      announcement at the -- at the beginning of this session.  

25      God save the United States and this Honorable Court.

1      There -- there are many people who don't believe in God.  

2                          MR. HUNGAR:    That's correct, Your Honor.  

3      And clearly -­

4                          JUSTICE SCALIA:    So that's okay?  

5                          MR. HUNGAR:    Yes.  

6                          JUSTICE SCALIA:    Why -- why is that okay?  

7                          MR. HUNGAR:    Whether -- if -- perhaps I  

8      misunderstood the hypothetical.    If the hypothetical is  

9      as you described with a different minister, with -- with  

10      an open process, a nondiscriminatory process like the  

11      one we have here, I think it would be a much closer case  

12      than this one, but it might be constitutional.    But  

13      whether that case is constitutional or not, this case is  

14      far from the constitutional line, further from the  

15      constitutional line than the State legislature's  

16      practice in Marsh.    Because there, Nebraska had one  

17      chaplain from one denomination for 16 years and yet,  

18      that was constitutionally permissible, and his prayers  

19      were not distinguishable in content from the prayers at  

20      issue here during the time that was relevant to the  

21      case.  

22                          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:    Would it make a  

23      difference in your analysis if instead of, as I  

24      understand the hypothetical, there was a point of  

25      saying, all rise or something of that sort?    Would it

1      make a difference if the hypothetical Justice Kagan  

2      posed were the same except people weren't told to rise  

3      or invited to rise or, in fact, were told to stay  

4      seated, something like that, so there would be no  

5      indication of who was participating in the prayer?    Is  

6      that a -- is that a ground of distinction that you're  

7      willing to accept or not?  

8                          MR. HUNGAR:    I don't think that is  

9      constitutionally significant, unless -- I mean, it might  

10      be different if people are compelled to stand, but  

11      whether they are or not -- I mean, in the Marsh case  

12      itself, Senator Chambers testified that the practice in  

13      the Nebraska legislature was for people to stand and he  

14      felt coerced to stand.    Because when he was there -- he  

15      tried to avoid it -- but when he was there, he felt he  

16      needed to stand because everybody else was doing it and  

17      he needed to have dealings with these people as a fellow  

18      legislator.  

19                          The Court, nonetheless, held that he's an  

20      adult and he -- he is expected to be able to disagree  

21      with things that he disagrees with and that is not a  

22      constitutional violation.  

23                          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:    I wonder how far you  

24      can carry the -- your historical argument and whether  

25      some of these things are properly regarded as more

1      historical artifacts, right?    I mean, our motto is "In  

2      God we trust," right?    That's the motto.    It's been that  

3      for a long time, right?  

4                          MR. HUNGAR:    Yes, sir.  

5                          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:    But wouldn't we look  

6      at it differently if there were -- suddenly if there  

7      were a proposal today for the first time, to say let's  

8      adopt a motto "In God we trust"?    Would we view that the  

9      same way simply because it's -- in other words, the  

10      history doesn't make it clear that a particular practice  

11      is okay going on in the future.    It means, well, this is  

12      what they've done -- they have done, so we're not going  

13      to go back and revisit it.    Just like we're not going to  

14      go back and take the cross out of every city seal that's  

15      been there since, you know, 1800.    But it doesn't mean  

16      that it would be okay to adopt a seal today that would  

17      have a cross in it, does it?  

18                          MR. HUNGAR:    Not necessarily.    But -- but I  

19      think history is clearly important to the Establishment  

20      Clause analysis under this Court's precedence in two  

21      significant respects, both of which apply here, one of  

22      which might not apply in your -- with respect to your  

23      hypothetical.  

24                          The first being the history shows us that  

25      the practice of legislative prayer, just like the motto,

1      has not, in fact, led to an establishment and,  

2      therefore, we can be confident it is not in danger of  

3      doing so.    And secondly, the history of legislative  

4      prayer, unlike your hypothetical, goes back to the very  

5      framing of the First Amendment.    The fact that -- then  

6      this is what the Court said in Marsh -- the fact that at  

7      the very time the First Congress was writing and sending  

8      the -- the First Amendment out to the States to be  

9      ratified, they adopted the practice of having a  

10      congressional chaplain.    And the congressional  

11      chaplain -- the record -- the historical record is  

12      clear -- gave prayers that were almost exclusively  

13      sectarian, as Respondents define that word.  

14                          JUSTICE SCALIA:    I don't really understand  

15      your -- your answer.    How can it be that if the practice  

16      existed in the past, it was constitutional?    Was it  

17      constitutional in the past?  

18                          MR. HUNGAR:    Yes, Your Honor.  

19                          JUSTICE SCALIA:    If it was constitutional in  

20      the past, why -- why would it be unconstitutional if the  

21      same thing is done today, even without any past parallel  

22      practice.    That's a nice alliteration.    Is past parallel  

23      practice essential?  

24                          MR. HUNGAR:    I think this Court's precedents  

25      have also indicated, at least in some cases, that if --

1      if a practice is constitutional, as we know it to be the  

2      case because of the fact that it has been understood to  

3      be constitutional and consistent with our religion  

4      clauses from the founding, other practices that have no  

5      greater impact, no greater tendency to establish  

6      religion, are equally constitutional.    And we believe  

7      that is an appropriate doctrine.  

8                          JUSTICE GINSBURG:    Is there -- is there any  

9      constitutional historical practice with respect to this  

10      hybrid body?    It's not simply a legislature.    It has a  

11      number of administrative functions.    Sometimes it  

12      convenes as a town meeting.    Sometimes it entertains  

13      zoning applications.    Is there a history for that kind  

14      of hybrid body, as there is for the kind of legislature  

15      we had in Nebraska or our Congress?  

16                          MR. HUNGAR:    Yes, Your Honor, in two  

17      respects.    First of all, the Becket Fund amicus brief  

18      identifies various examples of -- of municipal  

19      government prayer over the course of our founding, which  

20      is -- over the course of our history, which is not  

21      surprising given this -- the legislative practice at the  

22      State and Federal level as well.  

23                          And secondly, Congress for much of its -- of  

24      much of our history entertained private bills, which  

25      would be the equivalent in terms of legislative or

1      non-purely legislative functions you're talking about,  

2      with what the Town of Greece does here.  

3                          JUSTICE KENNEDY:    Well, if we had a -- if we  

4      had a series of cases, what -- what is a -- a utility  

5      rate-making board would come to the Supreme Court.    We  

6      say, well, it's enough like a legislative that it's like  

7      Marsh.    But I don't think the public would understand  

8      that.  

9                          MR. HUNGAR:    Well, Your Honor, whatever -­

10      whatever line might be drawn between non-legislative  

11      bodies and legislative bodies, what we are talking about  

12      here is a legislative meeting of a legislative body, and  

13      it would be -- it would be incongruous, as this Court  

14      said in Marsh, if Congress could have legislative  

15      prayers and the States couldn't.    It would be equally  

16      incongruous -­

17                          JUSTICE KENNEDY:    Well, the essence of the  

18      argument is we've always done it this way, which has  

19      some -- some force to it.    But it seems to me that your  

20      argument begins and ends there.  

21                          MR. HUNGAR:    No, Your Honor.    I mean, as  

22      we -- as we said in our brief, the principles that  

23      undergird the Establishment Clause are equally  

24      consistent with the position we're advancing here.    As

1      indicates, the fundamental -- the core of Establishment  

2      Clause concern is coercion or conduct that is so extreme  

3      that it leads to the establishment of a religion because  

4      it is putting the government squarely behind one faith  

5      to the exclusion of others, and that's clearly not -­

6      not what's going on here.  

7                          JUSTICE ALITO:    May I ask you about the  

8      individual plaintiffs here.    And what do we know about  

9      them?    They obviously have appeared at proceedings and  

10      they object to the proceedings.    Does the record show  

11      that they had matters before the town council during the  

12      hearings part of the proceeding?  

13                          MR. HUNGAR:    No, Your Honor.    There is -­

14      there's no evidence of that.    There's no -- the  

15      Respondents have no standing to assert the interests of  

16      children or police officers or award recipients or -- or  

17      permit applicants.    They don't even claim to be in -- in  

18      any of those categories.  

19                          JUSTICE ALITO:    Well, what about the public  

20      forum part?    They did speak occasionally then; isn't  

21      that right?  

22                          MR. HUNGAR:    Yes, Your Honor.  

23                          JUSTICE ALITO:    Do we know what they spoke  

24      about?  

25                          MR. HUNGAR:    Well, on at least one occasion

1      one of them spoke about the prayer -- or on one or two  

2      occasions; and then on multiple occasions spoke about a  

3      cable access channel issue.  

4                          JUSTICE ALITO:    And what did they -- what  

5      was the issue there?  

6                          MR. HUNGAR:    Something about -- she was  

7      expressing vehement disagreement with the town's  

8      decision to award a cable access channel to one entity  

9      as opposed to another.  

10                          JUSTICE BREYER:    Do you have any objection  

11      to -- to doing one thing that was suggested in the  

12      circuit court opinion, which is to publicize rather  

13      thoroughly in -- in the area that those who were not  

14      Christians, and perhaps not even religious, are also  

15      welcome to appear and to have either a prayer or the  

16      equivalent if they're not religious?    Do you have an  

17      objection to that?  

18                          MR. HUNGAR:    Certainly not.    There'd be -­

19                          JUSTICE BREYER:    Well, then -- then there -­

20      is there a disagreement on that point, because  

21      certainly, that was one of the concerns.    It wasn't on  

22      anyone's website.    There are -- Greece is a small town  

23      very near Rochester, and there are, at least in  

24      Rochester, lots of people of different religions,  

25      including quite a few of no religion.

1                          So -- so could you work that out, do you  

2      think, if that were the only objecting point?  

3                          MR. HUNGAR:    I -- I don't know what the  

4      town's position would be on that, but it -- certainly,  

5      there would be no constitutional problem with doing  

6      that.    I mean, here as a practical matter, since -­

7                          JUSTICE BREYER:    No, no.    I'm not saying  

8      it's a constitutional problem I got from the opinion of  

9      doing the opposite, of -- of not making an effort to  

10      make people who are not Christian feel, although they  

11      live near in or near the town or are affected thereby,  

12      participants over time.  

13                          MR. HUNGAR:    But, Your Honor, it's a  

14      perfectly rational approach when -- when any legislative  

15      body is going to have a practice of legislative prayer,  

16      to go to the houses of worship in the community.  

17                          JUSTICE BREYER:    I'm not saying it's not.    I  

18      want to know if you have any objection.    I -­

19                          MR. HUNGAR:    Well, I certainly don't think  

20      it is constitutionally required, although I would note  

21      that as a practical matter that has happened here in  

22      2007.  

23                          JUSTICE BREYER:    Do you -- would you have -­

1      others, would you object to doing it?  

2                          MR. HUNGAR:    I don't know what the town's  

3      position is on that.    As I said, as a practical matter,  

4      that has already happened here.    The town deputy  

5      supervisor was quoted in the newspaper saying anyone can  

6      come in prayer, anyone can -­

7                          JUSTICE BREYER:    Yes.    That's different from  

8      putting it on a website.    That's different from making  

9      an organized effort to see that people get the word.  

10                          MR. HUNGAR:    As I say -­

11                          JUSTICE SCALIA:    Mr. Hungar, what -- what is

13                            ARGUMENT OF IAN H. GERSHENGORN,  

14                       FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

17      it please the Court:  

18                          The Second Circuit's decision here requires  

19      courts to determine when a legislature has permitted too  

20      many sectarian references in its prayers or has invited  

21      too many Christian prayer-givers.    That approach is  

22      flawed for two reasons.  

23                          First, it cannot be squared with our  

24      nation's long history of opening legislative sessions  

25      not only with a prayer, but a prayer given in the

1      prayer-giver's own religion idiom.    And second, it  

2      invites exactly the sort of parsing of prayer that Marsh  

3      sought to avoid and that Federal courts are ill-equipped  

4      to handle.  

5                          JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:    And what was the purpose  

6      of Marsh saying that proselytizing or damning another  

7      religion would be a constitutional violation?  

8                          MR. GERSHENGORN:    So we agree with -­

9                          JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:    So unless you parse the  

10      prayers, you can't determine whether there's  

11      proselytizing or damnation.    That is Judge Wilkinson's  

12      point when he was faced with this question, which is,  

13      you have to, to do some parsing.  

14                          MR. GERSHENGORN:    So, Your Honor, you have  

15      to look at -- at the prayer to determine proselytizing.  

16      But it's a very different series of judgments, we  

17      submit, than determining whether something is sectarian.  

18      The kinds of debates we're having, I think, are  

19      reflected in the differences -­

20                          JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:    Now, seriously,  

21      counselor.    You can't argue that the quote that Justice  

22      Kagan read is not sectarian.    It invokes Jesus Christ as  

23      the savior of the world.    There are many religions who  

24      don't believe that.    Let's get past that.  

25                          MR. GERSHENGORN:    So, Your Honor --

1                          JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:    This is sectarian.  

2                          MR. GERSHENGORN:    We agree that these are  

3      sectarian.    But the kinds of debates that you're seeing  

4      among the parties, whether, for example, 15 percent, 50  

5      percent, 60 percent of the congressional prayers are  

6      sectarian.    Those are debates about whether "Holy  

7      Spirit" is sectarian.    A court -- a district court has  

8      held that "Allah" is not sectarian.  

9                          JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:    So let's talk about the  

10      context instead of prayer.    If the Chief Justice got up  

11      at the beginning of this session and said "All rise for  

12      a prayer," would you sit down?  

13                          MR. GERSHENGORN:    Your Honor, whether I  

14      would sit or not, we don't think that that would be  

15      constitutional.  

16                          JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:    Do you think -- how many  

17      people in this room do you think would sit, talking

19                          MR. GERSHENGORN:    I don't think -- I don't  

20      think many would sit, Your Honor.  

21                          JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:    All right.

1      this nature are being held, when the guy who's about,  

2      the chairman of this legislative body, is about to rule  

3      on an application you're bringing to him or her, why do  

4      you think any of those people wouldn't feel coerced to  

5      stand?  

6                          MR. GERSHENGORN:    So, Your Honor, I'd like  

7      to address the coercion point this way:    With respect to  

8      town councils, it's our view that as a general matter  

9      that the municipal legislatures can invoke the same  

10      tradition of solemnizing and invoking divine guidance as  

11      Federal and State legislatures.    We recognize there are  

12      differences, however, and Your Honor has pointed to one  

13      and that's the -- what was called the public forum here.  

14      And we think it's very -- because those are the ones  

15      where the -- is adjudicated license applications, liquor  

16      applications.    And we do think it is important on this  

17      record that those are separated in time.    It's at the  

18      court of appeals Appendix 929 and 1120.    So that the  

19      meeting starts at 6:00, which is in the prayer -- when  

20      the prayer is, but the board meetings to adjudicate  

21      those types of issues are at 6:30 or 6:32.  

22                          And so the type of concern that Your Honor  

23      has raised is not presented on this record and we think  

24      that's significant.    We think some of the other  

25      factors --

1                          JUSTICE KAGAN:    Mr. Gershengorn, do you  

2      think that if the legislature -- excuse me -- if the  

3      town board here just, you know, started it off with a  

4      prayer and then kept on going, do you think that that  

5      would be a significantly different case and you would  

6      switch sides?  

7                          MR. GERSHENGORN:    I don't know that we would  

8      switch sides, Your Honor.    But I do think it mitigates  

9      the coercion that the -- that the Respondents have  

10      identified.    And we think it -- that that is one of the  

11      significant differences between the town, the -- the  

12      town legislature and a -- and the legislature -­

13                          JUSTICE SCALIA:    You agree that coercion is  

14      the test, however?  

15                          MR. GERSHENGORN:    We don't agree that  

16      coercion is the test, Your Honor.  

17                          JUSTICE SCALIA:    If it is the test -­

18                          MR. GERSHENGORN:    We think it's the  

19      history -- we think the history is the -- the principal  

20      guidance of Marsh is -- we think there are three pillars  

21      in Marsh:    First of all, that the history is what the  

22      Court looks to first.    And here there was a long history  

23      of legislative prayer.    Second, that the Court should be  

24      very wary of parsing prayer to make sectarian judgments.  

25      And third, what Marsh said is that adults are less

1      susceptible to religious doctrine -- indoctrination and  

2      peer pressure.  

3                          JUSTICE KAGAN:    Mr. Gershengorn, could you  

4      respond to this?    Here's what our -- our country  

5      promises, our Constitution promises.    It's that, however  

6      we worship, we're all equal and full citizens.    And I  

7      think we can all agree on that.  

8                          And that means that when we approach the  

9      government, when we petition the government, we do so  

10      not as a Christian, not as a Jew, not as a Muslim, not  

11      as a nonbeliever, only as an American.    And what  

12      troubles me about this case is that here a citizen is  

13      going to a local community board, supposed to be the  

14      closest, the most responsive institution of government  

15      that exists, and is immediately being asked, being  

16      forced to identify whether she believes in the things  

17      that most of the people in the room believe in, whether  

18      she belongs to the same religious team as most of the  

19      people in the room do.  

20                          And it strikes me that that might be  

21      inconsistent with this understanding that when we relate  

22      to our government, we all do so as Americans, and not as  

23      Jews and not as Christians and not as nonbelievers.  

24                          MR. GERSHENGORN:    So, Justice Kagan, I think  

25      we agree with much of what you say.    But -- but with the

1      difference here is that this approaching of the  

2      government body occurs against the backdrop of 240 years  

3      of history, which makes this different.  

4                          From the very beginning of our legislature,  

5      from the First Continental Congress, and then from  

6      the -- from the first Congress, there have been  

7      legislative prayers given in the religious idiom of  

8      either the official chaplain or a guest chaplain, that  

9      have regularly invoked the -- the deity and the -- the  

10      language of the prayer-giver.    And that -­

11                          JUSTICE GINSBURG:    Mr. Gershengorn, your -­

12      your brief is the one who brought up -- and you were  

13      quite candid about it -- the hybrid nature of that body.  

14      I think it's on pages 22 to 24 of your brief.    And you  

15      say it would be proper to have certain checks in that  

16      setting.    So for one, make sure that the entrance and  

17      the exit is easy.    For another, inform the people in  

18      town of the tradition so they won't be confused.  

19                  But you recognize on the one hand that this isn't  

20      like Congress or the Nebraska legislature, and then you  

21      say these would be nice things to do.    Are you saying  

22      just that it would be good and proper or are you saying  

23      it would be necessary given the hybrid nature of this  

24      body?  

25                          MR. GERSHENGORN:    So, Your Honor, with

1      respect to some of the things we identify which are  

2      similar to the ones that Justice Breyer recommended, I  

3      think our view is they're more akin to safe harbors,  

4      that there are undoubtedly advancement challenges that  

5      could be brought.    And to the extent that the town can  

6      point to things such as -- such as public criteria and  

7      things like that, that is helpful.  

8                          With respect to the -- the public forum  

9      aspect, I don't think we have a position as to whether  

10      it is required, but we do think that that makes this  

11      case the much easier case, because of that separation of  

12      the one part that is the strongest argument for the  

13      other side, that there is an element of coercion, that  

14      your application is -- is being ruled on, that the  

15      separation the town has adopted makes that much less  

16      persuasive.  

17                          We think the other elements that the  

18      Respondents have pointed to for coercion are ones that  

19      trouble us because they are things that have analogs in  

20      our history.    So, for example, they point to the  

21      presence of children.    But, of course, on the Senate  

22      floor are the Senate pages, who are all high school  

23      juniors.    And as the reply brief points out, there are  

24      often children in the galleries at State legislatures  

25      being acknowledged.    And so some of those -- those

1      elements that the Respondents have pointed to for  

2      coercion we think are not ones that the Court should -­

3      should adopt.  

4                          JUSTICE KENNEDY:    Of course, your -- your  

5      test is whether or not -- part of your test -- is  

6      whether or not it advances religion.    If you ask a  

7      chaplain for the State assembly in Sacramento,  

8      California, who's going to go to the assembly to deliver  

9      a prayer, are you going to advance your religion today,  

10      would he say oh, no?  

11                          MR. GERSHENGORN:    So, Your Honor, I think  

12      it's a much narrower test.    What this Court said in  

13      Marsh was that the limit on legislative prayers is  

14      prosle -- does it proselytize, advance, or denigrate any  

15      one religion.    We think with respect to the content of  

16      the prayer, that the Second Circuit got it just about  

17      right, that the question is does it preach conversion,  

18      does it threaten damnation to nonbelievers, does it  

19      belittle a particular -­

20                          JUSTICE KENNEDY:    So -- so you -- you use  

21      the word "advance" only as modified by "proselytize"?  

22                          MR. GERSHENGORN:    What Marsh said was  

23      "proselytize, advance, or denigrate."  

24                          JUSTICE KENNEDY:    Because that's -- that's  

25      not what your -- your brief says "does not proselytize

28  

1      or advance."  

2                          MR. GERSHENGORN:    That -- that's the  

3      language from Marsh, Your Honor, is to proselytize or -­

4      "proselytize, advance, or denigrate."  

5                          JUSTICE KENNEDY:    But that's that the test  

6      you want us to adopt and -­

7                          MR. GERSHENGORN:    It is, Your Honor.  

8                          JUSTICE KENNEDY:    -- I'm asking whether or  

9      not it is, in fact, honest and candid and fair to ask  

10      the minister or -- or the priest or the chaplain or the  

11      rabbi if by appearing there, he or she seeks to advance  

12      their religion?  

13                          MR. GERSHENGORN:    So, Your Honor, I don't  

14      think that's what Marsh meant by advance.  

15                          JUSTICE KENNEDY:    If not, I'm not quite sure  

16      why they're there.  

17                          MR. GERSHENGORN:    You're not quite sure why  

18      "advance" is there, or why the rabbi is there.    We don't  

19      think that the mere presence of the rabbi -- that's what  

20      Marsh held, that Marsh -- what Marsh says is "advance"  

21      does not mean having a single -- a single chaplain -- a  

22      chaplain of a single denomination or looking at the  

23      content of the sectarian prayer in light of that  

24      history.

3                          ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS LAYCOCK

5                          MR. LAYCOCK:    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it  

6      please the Court:  

7                          Petitioner's answer to Justice Kagan's  

8      opening question is entirely formalistic.    There is no  

9      separation in time between the public hearing and the  

10      invocation.    People appear before this town board to ask  

11      for personal and specific things.    Our clients put shows  

12      on the cable channel.    They were concerned the cable  

13      channel was about to be abolished or made much less  

14      usable.    People appear to ask for a group home, parents  

15      of a Down syndrome child.    There are many personal  

16      petitions presented at this -- in the immediate wake of  

17      the prayer.  

18                          JUSTICE ALITO:    But that's during the public  

19      -- that's during the public forum part.  

20                          MR. LAYCOCK:    That's in the public forum.

22      not the same thing as the hearing.  

23                          MR. LAYCOCK:    It's not the same thing as the  

24      hearing and that's the point, Your Honor.

1      another part of the proceeding that is the hearing.  

2                          MR. LAYCOCK:    Yes.  

3                          JUSTICE ALITO:    And that's when somebody has  

4      a specific proposal.    They want to -- something  

5      specifically before the board and they want relief.  

6      They want a variance.  

7                          MR. LAYCOCK:    The -- the hearing is a  

8      particular kind of proposal.  

9                          JUSTICE ALITO:    And that is separated in  

10      time.  

11                          MR. LAYCOCK:    That is -- that is somewhat  

12      separated in time.    The forum is not.    And people make  

13      quite personal proposals there.    They ask for board  

14      action.    They often get board action.  

15                          JUSTICE ALITO:    But that is a legislative  

16      body at that point.    It's clearly a legislative body, is  

17      it not?    The only -- the difference is it's a town  

18      rather than -- than Congress or a State legislature  

19      where you have more formalized procedures.    This is -­

20      this is more direct democracy.    Or it's like a -- it's a  

21      town meeting.  

22                          MR. LAYCOCK:    It is -- it is direct  

23      democracy.    When a citizen appears and says, solve the  

24      traffic problem at my corner, solve this nuisance family  

25      that commits a lot of crimes in my block, that's not

4                          JUSTICE ALITO:    Well, if that is your

19      acceptable to Christians, Jews, Muslims, Buddhists,

1                          MR. LAYCOCK:    We -- we take Marsh to -- to  

2      imply that atheists cannot get full relief in this  

3      context, and the McCreary dissenters said that  

4      explicitly.    So points on which believers are known to  

5      disagree is a -- is a set that's in the American  

6      context, the American civil religion, the  

7      Judeo-Christian tradition -­

8                          JUSTICE ALITO:    Give me an example then.    I  

9      think the point about atheists is a good point.    But  

10      exclude them for present purposes and give me an example  

11      of a prayer that is acceptable to all of the groups that  

12      I mentioned.  

13                          MR. LAYCOCK:    About a third of the prayers  

14      in this record, Your Honor, are acceptable.  

15                          JUSTICE ALITO:    Give me an example.  

16                          MR. LAYCOCK:    Can I have the joint appendix?  

17                          The prayers to the almighty, prayers to the  

18      creator.  

19                          JUSTICE ALITO:    To "the almighty."  

20                          MR. LAYCOCK:    Yes.  

21                          JUSTICE ALITO:    So if -- if a particular  

22      religion believes in more than one god, that's  

23      acceptable to them?  

24                          MR. LAYCOCK:    Well, some religions that  

25      believe in more than one god believe that all their many

1      gods are manifestations of the one god.    But the true  

2      polytheists I think are also excluded from the McCreary  

3      dissent.  

4                          JUSTICE SCALIA:    What about devil  

5      worshippers?  

6                          (Laughter.)  

7                          MR. LAYCOCK:    Well, if devil worshippers  

8      believe the devil is the almighty, they might be okay.  

9      But they're probably out -­

10                          (Laughter.)  

11                          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:    Who is going to make  

12      this determination?    Is it -- is it an ex ante  

13      determination?    You have to review the proposed prayer?  

14                          MR. LAYCOCK:    I'm just flipping through.  

15      There are a number of examples, but if you look at page  

16      74a of the joint appendix, the prayer from August 13,  

17      2003 -- no I'm sorry.    That ends "in Christ's name."  

18                          But there are -- the count was about, about  

19      two-thirds, one-third.    So there are plenty of them in  

20      here.  

21                          JUSTICE ALITO:    74a, "Heavenly father,"  

22      that's acceptable to all religions?  

23                          MR. LAYCOCK:    "Heavenly Father" is very  

24      broadly acceptable.    And you know, the test cannot be  

25      unanimity, because that's impossible, right?    That's why

1      the atheists are -- that's why the atheists are  

2      excluded.  

3                          I'm sorry, Justice Scalia; would you repeat  

4      your question?  

5                          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:    Well, I'll repeat  

6      mine.    It was:    Who was supposed to make these  

7      determinations?    Is there supposed to be an officer of  

8      the town council that will review?    Do prayers have to  

9      be reviewed for his approval in advance?  

10                          MR. LAYCOCK:    No.    Principally the clergy  

11      make this determination.    There is a 200-year tradition  

12      of this kind of civic prayer.    The clergy know how to do  

13      it.    If the city has a policy, then an occasional  

14      violation by one clergy is not the city's  

15      responsibility.  

16                          So -- so this is left principally to the  

17      clergy by simply giving them instructions.    They receive  

18      no instruction of any kind about the purpose of this  

19      prayer or -­

20                          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:    So there is an  

21      official in the town council that is to instruct clergy  

22      about what kind of prayer they can say?  

23                          MR. LAYCOCK:    That's right.    37 State  

24      legislative bodies, the House of Representatives have  

25      these kinds of guidelines.    They issue them to the guest

1      clergy before they appear.  

2                          JUSTICE KENNEDY:    And if I'm -- if I'm that  

3      official and I think a prayer was over the top for being  

4      proselytizing and particularly sectarian, I would say I  

5      rather not -- you not come back next week; I am going to  

6      look for somebody else?  

7                          MR. LAYCOCK:    Well, you might have a  

8      conversation with him first and -­

9                          JUSTICE KENNEDY:    Well, so in other words  

10      the government is now editing the content of prayers?  

11                          MR. LAYCOCK:    Editing the content of  

12      government-sponsored prayers.    Of course these clergy  

13      can pray any way they want on their own time with their  

14      own audience.    But this is an official government event.  

15      And it's part of the board's meeting.    It's sponsored by  

16      the government.    And they delegate the task to these  

17      clergy and they can define the scope of that -­

18                          JUSTICE SCALIA:    Your point is that it  

19      coerces, it's bad because it coerces?  

20                          MR. LAYCOCK:    It coerces the people who are  

21      about to stand up and ask for things from the board  

22      and -­

23                          JUSTICE SCALIA:    If there is -- if coercion  

24      is the test of the Free Exercise Clause, why do we need  

25      a Free Exercise Clause?    If there's coercion -- I'm

1      sorry -- of the Establishment Clause, why do we need the  

2      Establishment Clause?    If there's coercion, I assume it  

3      would violate the Free Exercise Clause, wouldn't it?  

4                          MR. LAYCOCK:    Well, I think that's right.  

5      And that's why -­

6                          JUSTICE SCALIA:    So it seems to me very  

7      unlikely that the test for the Establishment Clause is  

8      identical to the test for the Free Exercise Clause.  

9                          MR. LAYCOCK:    Well, it seems to me unlikely  

10      as well.    Coercion is one test for the Establishment  

11      Clause, but there is also broad agreement on the Court,  

12      and there has been, that sectarian endorsements are  

13      prohibited by the Establishment Clause.  

14                          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:    What exactly -­

15      since you are adopting the coercion test, what exactly  

16      is coercive in this environment?    Having to sit and  

17      listen to the prayer?  

18                          MR. LAYCOCK:    There are many coercive  

19      aspects here of varying degrees of importance.    Citizens  

20      are asked to participate, to join in the prayer.  

21      They're often asked to -­

22                          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:    They are asked to  

23      participate, and -- but not in any tangible way.    They  

24      say:    Well, I'm not going to participate, and  

25      everybody's just sitting there.

1                          MR. LAYCOCK:    They are often asked to  

2      physically participate, to stand or to bow their heads.  

3      The testimony is most of the citizens bow -- most of the  

4      citizens bow their heads whether they are asked to or  

5      not.    So people who are not participating are  

6      immediately visible.    The pastors typically say:  

7      "Please join me in prayer."    They offer the prayer on  

8      behalf of everyone there.    They talk about "our  

9      Christian faith."  

10                          JUSTICE SCALIA:    This is coercion?    He says,  

11      you know -- he says, "May we pray," and somebody doesn't  

12      want to pray, so he stays seated.  

13                          MR. LAYCOCK:    What's coercive about it is it  

14      is impossible not to participate without attracting  

15      attention to yourself, and moments later you stand up to  

16      ask for a group home for your Down syndrome child or for  

17      continued use of the public access channel or whatever  

18      your petition is, having just, so far as you can tell,  

19      irritated the people that you were trying to persuade.  

20                          JUSTICE ALITO:    Let me give you an example  

21      of a practice that's a little bit different.    Maybe  

22      you'll say it's a lot different from what the Town of  

23      Greece does.    First of all, this town starts out by  

24      making -- by proceeding in a more systematic and  

25      comprehensive way in recruiting chaplains for the month

38

1      or whatever it is.    So instead of just looking to all  

2      the houses of worship within the town, it identifies  

3      places of worship that may be outside the town  

4      boundaries that people within the town who adhere to a  

5      minority religion may attend.  

6                          And it makes it clear that it's open to  

7      chaplains of any religious -- of any religion on a  

8      rotating basis.    And then they have -- they structure  

9      their proceedings so that you have the prayer, and then  

10      the legislative part of the town meeting.  

11                          And then there's a clear separation in time  

12      and access between that part of the proceeding and the  

13      hearing where variances and things of that nature are  

14      held.  

15                          Now, you would still say that's  

16      unconstitutional because you have to add on that a  

17      prayer that is acceptable to everybody; is that it?    Is  

18      there any other problem with what I've just outlined?  

19                          MR. LAYCOCK:    Well, if the separation in  

20      time really works, that's part of the remedy that we've  

21      suggested that is possible here.    We still believe that  

22      prayers should be nonsectarian.  

23                          JUSTICE GINSBURG:    On the remedy, this case  

24      was remanded by the Second Circuit for the parties  

25      together with the court to work out appropriate relief.

1      And if you could tell us what you think that relief  

2      would be, because then that is a measure of the  

3      constitutional infraction.  

4                          So what would -- you put yourself before the  

5      district judge and propose the changes that you think  

6      would be necessary to bring this practice within the  

7      constitutional boundary.  

8                          MR. LAYCOCK:    Well, we think the town has to  

9      have a policy.  

10                          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:    Well, just to be  

11      clear, are you talking about what would be satisfactory  

12      to the Second Circuit or satisfactory to you?    Because  

13      you don't accept the Second Circuit's approach.  

14                          MR. LAYCOCK:    Well, we've tried to sort out  

15      the totality of the circumstances to make it clearer.  

16                          JUSTICE GINSBURG:    What my question was -­

19                          JUSTICE GINSBURG:    -- your theory, and you  

20      say existing situation violates the Constitution.    So  

21      what changes do you think would need to be made -­

22                          MR. LAYCOCK:    We think -­

23                          JUSTICE GINSBURG:    -- that would bring this  

24      within the constitutional boundary?  

25                          MR. LAYCOCK:    We think the town needs a

40  

1      policy.    The policy should give guidelines to chaplains  

2      that say:    Stay away from points in which believers are  

3      known to disagree.    And we think the town should do what  

4      it can to ameliorate coercion.    It should tell the  

5      clergy:    Don't ask people to physically participate.  

6      That's the most important thing.  

7                  The government suggests disclaimers might help.  

8      We think that's right.    The government suggests  

9      separating the prayer a bit more in time.    Some States  

10      put their prayer before the call to order.    The prayer  

11      could even be five minutes before the beginning of the  

12      meeting.  

13                          The coercion can't be entirely eliminated,  

14      but the gratuitous coercion, the things that are done  

15      that don't have to be done in order to have a prayer  

16      could be eliminated.    And we think those two pieces are  

17      the components of a remedy.  

18                          JUSTICE SCALIA:    Mr. Laycock, it seems to me  

19      that you're missing here is -- and this is what  

20      distinguishes legislative prayer from other kinds -- the  

21      people who are on the town board or the representatives  

22      who are in Congress, they're citizens.    They are there  

23      as citizens.    The judges here are not -- we're not here  

24      as citizens.    And as citizens, they bring, they bring to  

25      their job all of -- all of the predispositions that

41  

1      citizens have.  

2                          And these people perhaps invoke the deity at  

3      meals.    They should not be able to invoke it before they  

4      undertake a serious governmental task such as enacting  

5      laws or ordinances?  

6                          There is a serious religious interest on the  

7      other side of this thing that -- that -- that people who  

8      have religious beliefs ought to be able to invoke the  

9      deity when they are acting as citizens, and not -- not  

10      as judges or as experts in -- in the executive branch.  

11      And it seems to me that when they do that, so long as  

12      all groups are allowed to be in, there seems to me -- it  

13      seems to me an imposition upon them to -- to stifle the  

14      manner in which they -- they invoke their deity.  

15                          MR. LAYCOCK:    We haven't said they can't  

16      invoke the deity or have a prayer, and they can  

17      certainly pray any way they want silently or just before  

18      the meeting.    We've said they cannot impose sectarian  

19      prayer on the citizenry, and that is very different from  

20      what Congress does, it is very different from what this  

21      Court does.    Maybe the closest analogy is legislative  

22      committee hearings where the citizens interact.    We  

23      don't have a tradition of prayer there.  

24                          What -- what -- what the town board is doing  

25      here is very different from anything in the tradition

1      that they appeal to.

3      to take into account an aspect of this.    I mean, in my  

4      own opinion, I don't know of anyone else's, I'm not  

5      talking for others.    But one -- a major purpose of the  

6      religion clauses is to allow people in this country of  

7      different religion, including those of no religion, to  

8      live harmoniously together.  

9                          Now, given that basic purpose, what do we do  

10      about the problem of prayer in these kinds of  

11      legislative sessions?    One possibility is say, you just  

12      can't do it, it's secular.    But that is not our  

13      tradition.  

14                          MR. LAYCOCK:    That's correct.  

15                          JUSTICE BREYER:    All right.    The second  

16      possibility is the one that you are advocating.    And it  

17      has much to recommend it, try to keep  

18      non-denominational, try to keep it as inoffensive to the  

19      others as possible.    That's the upside.  

20                          The downside is seeing supervised by a judge  

21      dozens of groups, and today, there are 60 or 70 groups  

22      of different religions coming in and saying, no, that  

23      doesn't work for us, this doesn't work for us, and  

24      that's the nightmare that they are afraid of.  

25                          I mean, even in this town or in the area,

1      there are significant numbers, as well as Christians, of  

2      Jews, of Muslims, of Baha'is, of Hindus, and others.  

3                          All right.    So there's a third approach, and  

4      that is say, well, you can't have them if there's any  

5      aspect of coercion.    But we just saw people walking into  

6      this room, "God save the United States" and you want to  

7      win your case.    I didn't see people sitting down.  

8                          All right.    Then the fourth approach, which  

9      is the other that has -- makes its appearance here, is  

10      to say let's try to be inclusive.    Now, was enough -- in  

11      other words, so you didn't get the right prayer today,  

12      but you -- and even with the nonreligious, you know many  

13      believe in the better angels of our nature and the  

14      spiritual side of humankind; it's not impossible to  

15      appeal to them.    So you say, you'll have your chance.  

16                          And that's the thing I -- I would like you  

17      to explore.    I mean, is there a way of doing that or is  

18      that preferable to the other ways or do we get into  

19      trouble?  

20                          MR. LAYCOCK:    We think that rotation does  

21      not work.    First of all, because -- for several reasons,  

22      but most citizens come for a single issue to one or two  

23      meetings.    They get the prayer they get that night.  

24      They don't benefit from the rotation scheme.    Any  

25      rotation scheme will be dominated by the local majority,

1      maybe even disproportionate to its numbers.    Religious  

2      minorities -- unfamiliar minorities give the prayer.  

3      There are often political protests; there are often  

4      threats and hate mail.    They don't want to give the  

5      prayer.    And many city councils won't stand up to the  

6      political pressure and enable those people to give the  

7      prayer.  

8                          So there are multiple reasons why rotation  

9      does not solve the problem here.  

10                          We think nonsectarianism has a very long  

11      tradition.    The government is not a competent judge of  

12      religious truth, Madison said, that was not a  

13      controversial proposition in the founding.    And even in  

14      the first Congress, in the prayers they point to, there  

15      were no prayers there that violate our principle,  

16      invoking details in which believers disagree.    Because  

17      then, 98-1/2 percent of the population was Protestant,  

18      Christ was not yet a point that disbelievers disagreed.  

19                          JUSTICE ALITO:    Well, that gets exactly to  

20      the -- that gets exactly to the problem with your  

21      argument about nonsectarian prayer.    Yes, when -- at the  

22      beginning of the country, the population was  

23      98 percent-plus Protestant.    Then it became  

24      predominantly Christian.    Then it became predominant -­

25      almost exclusively Christian and Jewish.

1                          And it -- but now, it's not that -- it's -­

2      it's gone much further than that.    So we have a very  

3      religiously diverse country.    There are a lot of  

4      Muslims, there are a lot of Hindus, there are Buddhists,  

5      there are Baha'is, there are all sorts of other  

6      adherents to all sorts of other religions.    And they all  

7      should be treated equally, and -- but I don't -- I just  

8      don't see how it is possible to compose anything that  

9      you could call a prayer that is acceptable to all of  

10      these groups.  

11                          MR. LAYCOCK:    We -­

13      example.  

14                          MR. LAYCOCK:    We -- we cannot treat -- I'm  

15      not a pastor -- we cannot treat everybody, literally  

16      everybody equally without eliminating prayer altogether.  

17      We can treat the great majority of the people equally  

18      with the tradition of prayer to the almighty, the  

19      governor of the universe, the creator of the world -­

2      excluded the atheists, right?

15                          MR. LAYCOCK:    True poly -- true polytheists  

16      who don't understand their gods as manifestations of the  

17      one god are probably excluded.    I'm not sure many others

21      prayer in this country for 200 years.    There's a long  

22      tradition of civic prayer and the clergy know how to do  

23      it.    When in Greece, no one has told them that's what we  

24      want you to do.    And -- and I would say the one time the

1      government-sponsored, sectarian prayers that people  

2      disagreed about was when we imposed Protestant religious  

3      exercises on Catholic children in the 19th century.    And  

4      that produced mob violence, church burnings, and people  

5      dead in the streets.  

6                          JUSTICE KAGAN:    Mr. -­

7                          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:    We've already  

8      separated out, I thought, in our jurisprudence, children  

9      and adults.  

10                          MR. LAYCOCK:    Well, Lee v. Weisman twice  

11      reserves the question of whether adults might be subject  

12      to similar pressures.  

13                          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:    Well, you do accept  

14      the fact that children may be subject to subtle coercion  

15      in a way that adults are not, right?  

16                          MR. LAYCOCK:    In some ways that adults are  

17      not.    But there's -- there's no doubt that before you  

18      stand up to ask for relief from a governing body, you  

19      don't want to offend that body.    Adults are subject to  

20      coercion here.    And -- and no competent attorney would  

21      tell his client, it doesn't matter whether you visibly  

22      dissent from the prayer or not.    You try to have your

1      councils like Greece can have prayers if they are  

2      non-provocative, modest, decent, quiet,  

3      non-proselytizing.    That's your position?  

4                          MR. LAYCOCK:    I wouldn't use all those

16      different beliefs and thoughts in this country, and  

17      there will be people who say, but I cannot give such a  

18      prayer if I am a priest in that particular -- or a  

19      minister or whatever in that particular religion.    I  

20      must refer to the God -- to God as I know that God by  

21      name.    And what do we do with them?  

22                          That's what -- I mean, we can recommend it,

1      people and I respect that and they should not be giving  

2      government prayers.    They're taking on a government  

3      function when they agree to give the invocation for the  

4      town board.  

5                          JUSTICE KAGAN:    Mr. Laycock -­

6                          JUSTICE SCALIA:    Well, that's -- that's -­

7      that's really part of the issue, whether they're  

8      undertaking a government function or whether they're  

9      acting as citizens in a legislative body, representative  

10      of the people who bring -- who bring to that their -­

11      their own personal beliefs.  

12                          I think the average person who -- who -- who  

13      participates in a legislative prayer does not think that  

14      this is a governmental function.    It's a personal  

15      function.    And -- and that's why we separate out the  

16      legislative prayer from other kinds of prayers.  

17                          MR. LAYCOCK:    They're -- they're not praying  

18      for their congregation.    They are -- they are invited by  

19      the board, the prayer-giver is selected by the board,  

20      the board decides to have the prayer, the board gives  

21      this one person and only one person time on the agenda  

22      to pray.    This is clearly governmental as you held in  

23      Santa Fe -­

24                          JUSTICE SCALIA:    If you had an atheist  

25      board, you would not have any prayer.

2                          JUSTICE SCALIA:    I guarantee you, because it

10      resistance of some members of the Court to sitting as  

11      arbiters of what's sectarian and nonsectarian, and I  

12      join some skepticism as to knowing exactly where to join  

13      that line.    Assuming you accept that, what would be the  

14      test that you would proffer, taking out your preferred  

15      announcement that this prayer has to be nonsectarian?  

16                          MR. LAYCOCK:    Well, the test that we have  

17      proffered is the test from the McCreary dissent, points  

18      on which believers are known to disagree.    So you don't  

19      have to be a theologian.    Points on which people are  

20      commonly known to disagree, and the Fourth Circuit has  

21      had no difficulty administering this rule.    The cases  

22      that come to it are clearly sectarian or clearly  

23      nonsectarian.

5                          JUSTICE KENNEDY:    That may play ultimately  

6      in your position if we say that that's why there  

7      shouldn't be any prayer at all.    But then you have the  

8      problem mentioned by Justice Scalia that we are  

9      misrepresenting who we really are.  

10                          MR. LAYCOCK:    If you really believe  

11      government can't draw lines here, then your alternatives  

12      are either prohibit the prayer entirely or permit  

13      absolutely anything, including the prayer at the end of  

14      our brief, where they ask for a show of hands, how many  

15      of you believe in prayer?    How many of you feel  

16      personally in need of prayer?    If there are no limits,  

17      you can't draw lines.

23                          MR. LAYCOCK:    It was how he introduced his  

24      prayer, and if you can't draw lines I don't know why he  

25      can't say that.

7      community, but is not accepted by a minority, whether  

8      that language will be allowed in a public town session  

9      like this one.    That's really the question, isn't it?  

10                          MR. LAYCOCK:    That's the issue that actually  

11      arises in the case.  

12                          JUSTICE KAGAN:    That's the issue that  

13      actually arises.    Here's what -- I don't think that this  

14      is an easy question.    I think it's hard, because of  

15      this.    I think it's hard because the Court lays down  

16      these rules and everybody thinks that the Court is being  

17      hostile to religion and people get unhappy and angry and  

18      agitated in various kinds of ways.    This goes back to  

19      what Justice Breyer suggested.  

20                          Part of what we are trying to do here is to  

21      maintain a multi-religious society in a peaceful and  

22      harmonious way.    And every time the Court gets involved  

23      in things like this, it seems to make the problem worse  

24      rather than better.    What do you think?  

25                          MR. LAYCOCK:    Well, I don't -- I don't think

1      that's true.    There are people who distort your  

2      decisions.    There are people who misunderstand your  

3      decisions honestly and -- and innocently.    But keeping  

4      government neutral as between religions has not been a  

5      controversial proposition in this Court.    And I don't  

6      think the Fourth Circuit has made it worse.    They've got  

7      a workable rule and the prayers are no longer  

8      exclusively Christian prayers in the Fourth Circuit and  

9      they have been able to mostly enforce that and there  

10      hasn't been litigation at the margins because all the  

11      prayers were clearly -­

12                          JUSTICE BREYER:    Suppose you did this.    You  

13      combined your two approaches.    The town has to -- it  

14      cannot -- it must make a good faith effort to appeal to  

15      other religions who are in that area.    And then you have  

16      these words from the House:    "The chaplain should keep  

17      in mind that the House of Representatives, or you would  

18      say whatever relative group, "is comprised of members of  

19      many different faith traditions," period, end of matter.  

20      Is that sufficient, those two things?  

21                          MR. LAYCOCK:    That would help immensely.    We  

22      think some of the clergy need more detailed explanation  

23      of what that means, but yes, that would help immensely.  

24                          JUSTICE KENNEDY:    Should we write that in a  

25      concurring opinion?

1                          (Laughter.)  

2                          JUSTICE KENNEDY:    I mean, I'm serious about  

3      this.    This involves government very heavily in  

4      religion.  

5                          MR. LAYCOCK:    Well, government became very  

6      heavily involved in religion when we decided there could  

7      be prayers to open legislative sessions.    Marsh is the  

8      source of government involvement in religion.    And now  

9      the question is how to manage the problems that arise  

10      from that.  

11                          JUSTICE ALITO:    Well, Marsh is not the  

12      source of government involvement religion in this  

13      respect.    The First Congress is the source.  

14                          MR. LAYCOCK:    Fair enough.    The tradition to  

15      which Marsh points.  

16                          JUSTICE ALITO:    The First Congress that also  

17      adopted the First Amendment.  

18                          MR. LAYCOCK:    That -- that's correct, and  

19      that had prayers that did not address predestination or  

20      having to accept Jesus as your savior or any point on  

21      which listeners disagree.  

22                          JUSTICE ALITO:    Many of them were very  

23      explicitly Christian, were they not?  

24                          MR. LAYCOCK:    They were very explicitly  

25      Christian, but that was not a point of disagreement at

1      the time.    They stayed away from any issue that  

2      Protestants disagreed on.  

3                          JUSTICE KENNEDY:    In a way it sounds quite  

4      elitist to say, well, now, we can do this in Washington  

5      and Sacramento and Austin, Texas, but you people up  

6      there in Greece can't do that.  

7                          MR. LAYCOCK:    Well, it's not that the people  

8      in Greece can't do it.    It's just that this board is  

9      functioning in a fundamentally different way from what  

10      Congress or the State legislature functions.    And  

11      also -­

12                          JUSTICE ALITO:    My understanding is that the  

13      first chaplain of the Senate was the Episcopal bishop of  

14      New York; isn't that correct?    And he used to read -- he  

15      took his prayers from the Book of Common Prayer.    That  

16      was acceptable to Baptists at the time, Quakers?  

17                          MR. LAYCOCK:    Well, it wouldn't have been  

18      their choice.    But did he talk about the choice between  

19      bishops and presbyters and congregations as a way of  

20      governing the church?    They have not offered a single  

21      example of a prayer in the founding era that addressed  

22      points on which Protestants were known to disagree.    And  

23      I don't think there is one.    The founding generation  

24      kept government out of religious disagreements.    And  

25      what has changed is not the principle.    What has changed

1      is that we have a wider range of religious disagreements

4      you to affirm.  

5                          CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:    Thank you,  

6      Mr. Laycock.  

7                          Mr. Hungar, you have 3 minutes remaining.  

8                          REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR  

9                                 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER  

10                          MR. HUNGAR:    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.  

11                          First I would like to correct one factual  

12      misimpression, the assertion that only non-Christian  

13      prayer-givers delivered the prayer after 2008.    It's not  

14      in the record, but the official web site of the Town of  

15      Greece shows that at least four non-Christian  

16      prayer-givers delivered prayers thereafter in 2009, '10,  

17      '11 and '13.  

18                          On the sectarian points, clearly the line -­

19                          JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:    Counsel.  

20                          MR. HUNGAR:    I'm sorry?  

21                          JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:    One a year.  

22                          MR. HUNGAR:    I'm sorry, Your Honor?  

23                          JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:    Four additional people  

24      after the suit was filed.  

25                          MR. HUNGAR:    Yes, Your Honor.

1                          JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:    One a year.  

2                          MR. HUNGAR:    Approximately.  

3                          JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:    How often does the  

4      legislature meet?  

5                          MR. HUNGAR:    Once a month.  

6                          And on the sectarian line, I just like to  

7      point the Court to the Senate brief, the amicus brief  

8      filed by Senators, pages 8 to 17 which shows the  

9      extensive history from the beginning of the Republic  

10      until today of prayer in Congress.    That would be  

11      sectarian and unconstitutional under Respondent's  

12      position.  

13                          With respect to coercion, it's  

14      unquestionably true that there is less basis for  

15      claiming coercion here than there was in Marsh.    In  

16      Marsh, Senator Chambers was required to be on the Senate  

17      floor by rule, he had to be there to do his job and the  

18      practice was to stand every single time, which he did  

19      because he felt coerced to do it; whereas, here, the  

20      record suggests that there were three times when  

21      somebody requested people to stand out of 121 occasions.  

22      The idea that this is more coercive than Marsh is  

23      absurd.  

24                          In Marsh the Court expressly rejected a  

25      coercion argument saying, "We expect adults to be able

1      to deal with this."  

2                          With respect to the history, as well, I  

3      think the debate in the Continental Congress, when this  

4      issue was first raised, shows what the American  

5      tradition has been.    That is Americans are not bigots  

6      and we can stand to hear a prayer delivered in a  

7      legislative forum by someone whose views we do not agree  

8      with.    That is the tradition in this country, and that's  

9      why it doesn't violate the Establishment Clause.  

10                          And finally, with respect to the fact that  

11      this is a municipality rather than a state or local -­

12      Federal government.    That can't possibly make a  

13      difference as an Establishment Clause matter.    It makes  

14      no sense to suggest that a prayer at the local level is  

15      more dangerous for Establishment Clause purposes than  

16      what Congress is doing.    Only Congress could establish a  

17      religion for the entire nation, which is the core  

18      preventive purpose of the Establishment Clause.    To  

19      suggest that there are greater restrictions on  

20      municipalities makes no sense at all.  

21                          We think that the dangerously overbroad  

22      theories advanced by respondents are at odds with our  

23      history and traditions, which we reflect this tradition  

24      of tolerance for religious views that we don't agree  

25      with in the legislative context.

1                          Respondent's theories also conflict with the  

2      religion clauses mandate, that it's not the business of  

3      government to be regulating the content of prayer and
