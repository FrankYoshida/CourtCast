does knowing that you talked more tell you anything about your chance of winning, all other things being equal?

Say you are the petitioner, tie lawyers, and you are interrupted more. What is your chance of winning? P(w|ptp)  =  N(w,ptp) / N(w,ptp) + N(l,ptp)  =  N(w,ptp) / N(w,ptp) + N(w,rtp)

What is your chance of winning given that you also talked more?
P(w|ptpp)  =  N(w,ptpp / N(w,ptpp) + N(l,ptpp)  =  N(w,ptpp) / N(w,ptpp) + N(w,rtpp)


p_w = r_l and r_w = p_l

Iâ€™m not sure why the tied elements change between these two. Maybe there are some with 2 lawyers on each side; one side has the most-interrupted individual but the other side is more interrupted in total? The marginals are all the same. 

The problem is with how ties are handled.
