CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:     We will hear

argument next this morning in Case 11-889, Tarrant

Regional Water District v. Herrmann.

Mr. Rothfeld?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. ROTHFELD:     Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

In the Red River Compact, Oklahoma agreed

that Texas would be allowed to use a specified quantity

of water that is located in Oklahoma.     Oklahoma is now

trying to back out of that bargain.

What its argument to this Court in support

of its position is essentially that the Court should

disregard language that appears in the Red River Compact

because that language is superfluous, that the Court

should read into the Compact language that does not

appear there, and that the Court should not give the

text of the Compact what Oklahoma in its brief describes

as "talismanic significance."

Our very different view is that the plain

text of the Compact must control.

Now, in the Red River Compact, Texas and

Oklahoma, along with Louisiana and Arkansas, agreed to

allocate among themselves the waters of the Red River

Basin.     The Compact divides that basin into large areas

called reaches and subdivides the reaches into

subbasins.     As to some of those areas, the Compact

expressly allocates entitlement to water by State line.

It says that the States may use the water within their

boundaries exclusively.

But in the section of the Compact which is

at issue here, Reach 2, Subbasin 5, the Compact uses a

very different and unique language.     That section -­

that subbasin includes the territory of all -- three of

the four compacting States.     The boundaries of that

subbasin are drawn not by State lines, but by reference

to the -- the last downside dam sites before tributaries

to the Red River Basin -- Red River flow into the river

itself.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:     Mr. Rothfeld, we are told

that in other compacts when they really mean to give one

State the right to take another State's water, the

provision in the compact is much clearer, much more

definite.

This clause, the one that you rely on, is

kind of sketchy, isn't it?     Doesn't say how they're

going to get it, if they're going to pay for it.

There's a lot to be filled in.

MR. ROTHFELD:     Well, the provision that we

are relying on, I would say is not sketchy at all.     It

is quite clear that all four of the compacting States

are in the language of the Compact, have equal rights to

the use of water, defined water in a defined area of the

subbasin, so long as no State uses more than 25 percent

of the water.     That -- that is quite express as to what

is required.

In -- it's difficult to read that language

to mean anything other than that the States can take -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:     What is the exact language?

Do you want to read the exact language just to refresh

our recollection?

MR. CLEMENT:     It appears -- it is reprinted

on page 8 of the blue brief in the indented text, and it

says, "Within this -- within this subbasin, the

signatory States have equal rights to the use of," and

then it defines the water that they have the rights to

the use of, "at times of normal flow" -- with the flow

of the Red River at 3,000 cubic feet per second at the

Arkansas/Louisiana border -- "provided that no State is

entitled to more than 25 percent of the water in excess

of this amount."

So the -- the gist of the language is States

rights to the use of -­

JUSTICE BREYER:     It doesn't say that.     It

says, "No State is entitled to more than 25 percent."

It doesn't say -- I mean that language doesn't say what

happens if in fact there's a State that because of

cliffs or something can't get the 25 percent to which it

is entitled.     It just doesn't say anything about it.

MR. ROTHFELD:     Well, I have to disagree with

that.

JUSTICE BREYER:     Where does it say something

about it?

MR. ROTHFELD:     It says that -- the section

is designed to allocate the water of the subbasin, and

it says, "Within the subbasin, States have equal rights

to use of the runoff."     That's the first part of it.

JUSTICE BREYER:     Yes.

MR. ROTHFELD:     The second part of it then

says, "provided that no State is entitled to more than

25 percent" -­

JUSTICE BREYER:     All right.     Does that mean

that a State can, when it can't get its pipeline to the

river, go into some other State and take the water out

of that other State?     I mean, I would have thought, if

that was their intent, there would be a mechanism for

doing it.     That you'd have some authority set up by the

Compact that would decide where, whether it's really

true, and how are we supposed to do it, and there is no

such mechanism, rather if there is such a right, which

it doesn't say anything about, it's left to the State

courts in different States to try to do what is an

extremely complex and controversial administrative job.

MR. ROTHFELD:     A couple points to say about

that.     First of all, it is not at all a complex job.

JUSTICE BREYER:     It's not at all complex

when Oklahoma is going to say, Texas, go run the pipe to

the south of the Red River, and Texas is going to say,

I'm sorry, we can't get there, there's too much cactus.

And then they're going to say, don't you know that, in

fact, when you put your pipeline into Oklahoma, you are

going to be taking part of the 25 percent that belongs

to us.

And Texas will say, no, we aren't.     And then

we'll have to have a way of measuring how much goes into

the river at different places and what are all these

different pipelines are going to take out.     You

understand what I'm saying.

MR. ROTHFELD:     Right.     But -­

JUSTICE BREYER:     I would have thought a

mechanism would be set up to do that and there is none.

MR. ROTHFELD:     Okay.     Again, several things

about that.     First of all, in all these other compacts

to which Justice Ginsburg alludes that are cited by our

opponents, which expressly allow for cross-border -­

virtually none of them provide any of the kinds of

details that you are describing.

JUSTICE BREYER:     Fine.     But they do say

expressly, and I don't know what the terrain is like in

the other areas.     And here it does not say anything

about it.     That's why I think we're here in the Court

because all it says is you can't take more than

25 percent.     It doesn't say what happens when Texas is

unable to get its 25 percent from the south.     I'm now

repeating myself, but you point to the language that

says what I just say is not consistent with the

language.

MR. ROTHFELD:     What I say -- I guess I will

say two things about that.     One, I think what you just

say is, in fact, with respect, is not consistent with

the language.     I think that -­

JUSTICE BREYER:     Which language is it not

consistent with?

MR. ROTHFELD:     Equal rights to use of

specified water.     It -- the -- the subbasin is defined,

again, not by State lines, it's defined by -- by

downstream dam sites.     So it has created a pool of water

in the -- in this subbasin, and it says that all four

States have equal rights to use of this water, provided

that none takes more than 25 percent.

It seems to me that on the face of it, that

is saying State lines are not relevant and that what we

are looking at is a pool of water the States can come

and get it.     And it is particularly so -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:     Excuse me.

MR. ROTHFELD:     If I may just -- I'm sorry.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:     No, no.     Finish.

MR. ROTHFELD:     And I think to the extent

that there could be any ambiguity in the -- in that

language viewed in isolation, in the context of the rest

of the Compact, there are places where the drafters of

the Compact, in fact, did refer to State lines.     They

said that States are entitled to use the water within

their State boundaries, the respective States may use

the water within their boundaries.     They did not -- the

framers did not use that language in this provision.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:     I think under your

argument, and you can correct me if I'm wrong, that

Louisiana could decide it doesn't want to wait for the

flow of water to come to it, and it could just go right

into Oklahoma, in which it shares no border, and I don't

know how it's going to do that, and take its 25 percent.

Does that make sense in terms of the language?

MR. ROTHFELD:     Well, I will say two things

to that -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:     I mean, you're talking

about Texas, but Texas shares a border and so it may be

a little easier to cross the borderline.     But what's

Louisiana going to do?

MR. ROTHFELD:     Well, let me make two points

about that.

First of all, I think that not only does it

make sense in the language, it's compelled by the

language because the language says within this subbasin

all four States have equal rights.     Separately, there is

another separate reach.     Reach V of the -- the Compact

is Louisiana's, and so the water flows into Louisiana.

When the water gets to Louisiana, it's no longer within

the subbasin, it's somewhere else.

So the plain language of the Compact compels

the reading -- compels the -- the point that Louisiana

could take its water from within the subbasin.

Now, could it do that?     The subbasin runs

through to Arkansas to Louisiana, so it could go to

Louisiana -­

because what you have done is you've pushed me back to

the equal rights.     And now if I am going to fight you on

it, I have to say the equal rights to water means equal

rights to water arising within its boundaries.     And all

you have to say is equal rights to water arising

anywhere in the subbasin.

And if I just heard that, then I might say

okay, I think yours is a little better.     But -- but we

have this enormous administrative mess that would seem

to be created, and both those interpretations seem

possible.

So let's go back to that and let me hear

quite clearly, now that I've focused it, what's the

answer?

MR. ROTHFELD:     If I may just finish with

Justice Sotomayor and I will turn to that?

I think the second answer to the question

is, the States are going to take the water from the

closest point where they can get it.     And so Louisiana

is not going to go to Oklahoma.     If it's going to go

into Subbasin 5, it's going to go to Arkansas directly

across the State line.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:     How -- how does it do it?

Does it have to apply to Texas?

MR. ROTHFELD:     It has to apply to

JUSTICE GINSBURG:     To Oklahoma.

MR. ROTHFELD:     If it's going to Oklahoma,

and this is partially responsive to Justice Breyer, it

would have to apply to the water authorities within

Oklahoma.     So what is going on here, Tarrant, the Texas

water district, is applying to the Oklahoma Water

Resources Board.     It will seek a permit.     This will

operate precisely in the same way as if an Oklahoma

applicant is seeking a permit.

You will go to -- you will go and say, I

want to take water out of this point.     The Water

Resources Board will apply its ordinary standards to

determine whether or not that can be granted.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:     Who -- who erects the

facilities to accomplish this diversion?

MR. ROTHFELD:     Tarrant presumably will do

that.     If Tarrant needs to obtain rights of way,

Oklahoma law provides for exercise of eminent domain, or

Tarrant can simply purchase the property to do that.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:     It's -- it's my

understanding that there is a place where Texas can put

a line into the river, and then a subset of that

question is, the main stem of the river, through -­

without going through Oklahoma property, other than

perhaps just the bank itself.

MR. ROTHFELD:     That -- that I think is not

correct as a factual matter.     The -- the Red River lies

entirely within Oklahoma, and so Oklahoma, in order to

MR. ROTHFELD:     The -- the border between

Oklahoma and Texas is the south vegetation line of the

Red River, so therefore it is out of the river past the

bank to the vegetation line.     So in order to get water

laws that Tarrant is challenging here are laws that are

discriminatory Oklahoma laws that prevent any use of

water originating in Oklahoma outside.

JUSTICE ALITO:     When you say Texas has the

right to go into Oklahoma, just -- just think about that

phrase.     That's -- that's very striking.     I mean, it

sounds like they are going to send in the National Guard

or the Texas Rangers.

MR. ROTHFELD:     Right.     And that -- if I may,

Justice Alito, that is -- that's a very misleading way

of looking at it.     And I think Oklahoma's brief suggests

that the Texas Rangers are going to descend on Tulsa and

seize the water.     That is not what -- what is

contemplated.

JUSTICE ALITO:     But you were saying that

Oklahoma -- that Texas has the right to force Oklahoma

to take private property in Oklahoma by eminent

domain if necessary.

MR. ROTHFELD:     No, I -- there is an -- there

is an Oklahoma statute that says in order to -- someone

who has a permit to obtain water can exercise eminent

domain.     An Oklahoma person can do this.     A Texas person

can do this.

Oklahoma apply its law in this situation?     I assume

applications from a lot of people.     But they have to -­

what do they have to give Texas?     Up to 25 percent?

I mean, they can't just say -- deny it

because another Oklahoma user has priority, or all this.

How does that fit in with the existing administrative

structure?

MR. ROTHFELD:     Well, Oklahoma cannot use

more than 25 percent of the water within the subbasin.

I think that our friends concede that because the

language of the Compact says no State is entitled to

more than 25 percent.

Within each State's 25 percent allocation, a

resident water user of the State will apply to the

Oklahoma -- if they are seeking to take their water from

Oklahoma, it will apply to the Oklahoma Water Resources

Board, which will assess that permit precisely as it

assesses permits from Oklahoma residents.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:     But it's got to give

Texas at least up to its 25 percent, right?

MR. ROTHFELD:     If -- if there is a request

for that much water from a Texas user, and the Texas

asking is, does the Compact give Texas special priority

apart from what Oklahoma -- Oklahoma's priorities would

be?

MR. ROTHFELD:     No, it does not.     It's -­

all -- all the Compact says is that Texas is entitled to

take water from within the subbasin, its 25 percent.

Now when it applies in a particular place, as Tarrant

has done here, it's going to apply -- be consistent with

the Oklahoma -- Water Resources Board permit application

policies, as it has done.

The resources board will assess that permit

application just as it would assess an application

from -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:     And what does that mean

exactly?     What would Oklahoma do to evaluate that

application and to compare it to other applications from

Oklahomans, and also maybe to compare it -- maybe there

is more than one Texas application.

How does the Oklahoma board make those

decisions?

MR. ROTHFELD:     It -- a permit applicant

submits an application, which has to demonstrate that it

satisfies the standards for obtaining the water.     That

will be assessed on its merits by the Water Resources

Board.

If there are competing applications for the

priority -- of -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:     I'm really asking you to

tell me what the Oklahoma board is going to do.     I mean,

why doesn't the Oklahoma board just say, you know,

sorry, we like Oklahomans?     Would that be all right?

MR. ROTHFELD:     Well, that is their current

policy.     That would not be all right.

JUSTICE KAGAN:     What -- what -- what

different kind of priorities do they have to use, and

why do they have to use them, as I think -- somewhere

along the lines of what the Chief Justice was asking?

MR. ROTHFELD:     I suppose there -- there are

two points there.     One is, if there is enough water to

go around for everyone, as in fact there is, then they

simply assess it in terms of priority in time.     Whoever

makes the first application will get it.

However, Oklahoma can only get 25 -- use

25 percent of the water.     And therefore, Texas has the

right, so long as there is water available and Texas has

not used its 25 percent of the subbasin water.     Texas

has the right to seek that anywhere it can get it in the

subbasin.

If I may, Mr. Chief Justice.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN O'CONNELL,

FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

MS. O'CONNELL:     Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

The court of appeals concluded that Oklahoma

may categorically foreclose Texas water users from

accessing Reach II Subbasin 5 water in Oklahoma, and the

court reached that conclusion for reasons that in the

view of the United States are wrong.

First, the Court of Appeals erred in

applying a presumption against preemption to determine

whether the challenged Oklahoma laws conflict with the

Compact.     The rationale for that presumption where it

has been applied is one of federalism, but the States

themselves created the terms of the interstate Compact,

and respect for the States as sovereigns in that context

requires enforcement of the Compact according to its

terms.

Second, the court of appeals relied on

general Compact provisions to conclude that the Compact

gives States unrestricted authority to regulate the

water within their boundaries.     But the general

provisions of the Compact make clear that a State's

regulation of water has to be consistent with the

allocations made under the Compact, and each State's

obligations under the Compact.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:     Well, I -- I am not quite

sure I agree with your reading of the Court of Appeals'

opinion.     It seems to me the Court of Appeals' opinion

is consistent with the Respondents' argument that they

looked at the terms of the Compact.

And it seems to me that you may be right

that the Compact either says you get the water or you

don't, and the dormant Commerce Clause is just

irrelevant.     But I read the opinion of the court of

appeals as being quite consistent with that proposition.

You win or you lose, up or down, under the Compact.     The

dormant Commerce Clause doesn't -- just doesn't have

much to do with it.

MS. O'CONNELL:     Well, we agree with that.

We don't think that the dormant Commerce Clause comes

into play here.     We think that whether Texas can access

the water in Oklahoma through the Oklahoma permitting

process depends entirely on whether the Compact gives

them that right or not.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:     But that's the way I

read the analytic approach of the court of appeals at

39A, when it starts talking about the point of --

Section 5.05.

MS. O'CONNELL:     Right.     And we don't

disagree with that, that the -- that the commerce clause

shouldn't come into play here.

Where we disagree with the Court of Appeals

is with the Court of Appeals' conclusion that,

regardless of whether a State law would frustrate the

purpose or pose an obstacle to a State obtaining its

share of water under the Compact, that that State law

should prevail under the Compact.     So the Compact makes

clear that those general provisions preserving State

water law need to be consistent with each State's

obligations under the Compact.

And if I could -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:     Well, where, if

you're relying on the Compact and its language, where do

you come up with this idea that States first have to try

to get their 25 percent from water within their borders?

I don't see that anywhere.

MS. O'CONNELL:     Well, first of all, we think

that that's an issue that, if the Court decided that -­

that there are errors in the Court of Appeals' opinion

that should be corrected, we think that's something the

court of -- that the lower courts could consider on

remand.

But I'll tell you where it comes from, which

is Sections 2.01 and 2.10(a) of the Compact, which

preserve the application of State water law.     Section

2.01 says that, "Each State may freely administer water

rights and uses in accordance with the laws of that

State, but that such -- such uses shall be subject to

the availability of water in accordance with the

Compact."

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:     Well, it seems to me

that you like some provisions of State law, but not

others.

MS. O'CONNELL:     No.     What we're saying is

that if there's a State law that conflicts with the

allocation or poses an obstacle to the allocation of

water under the Compact, then it's preempted.

But, for example, if Texas could access

25 percent of the water from within its State, then

the -- the application of a State law that would bar

Texas water users from obtaining a portion of its water

in Oklahoma wouldn't necessarily be preempted because it

wouldn't pose an obstacle to the allocation.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:     What do you do -­

what do you do with a situation -- let's say there's

Oklahoma water available to Tarrant that is closer than

the water they would get from somewhere else in Texas.

Do they have to incur the additional expense to get

Texas water, or can they take the cheaper route and get

Oklahoma water?

MS. O'CONNELL:     Well, we think -- again, we

think this is a -- an issue for the court of -- for the

lower courts to look at on remand, but we think there's

a -- there's a good argument to be made that, so long as

Texas could access 25 percent of the water within its

boundaries, then application of an Oklahoma law that

would prohibit Texas from going through the Oklahoma

permitting process wouldn't necessarily be preempted.

And again, we -- these -- these -- there are

lots of issues, as we point out in our brief and we did

at the invitation stage, that would need to be

addressed, perhaps, in further proceedings or perhaps

before the -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:     Ms. O'Connell, isn't that a

reason why we shouldn't accept your basic view?     I mean,

if -- if you think of all the issues that you laid out

that are going to have to be decided and the difficulty

of those issues -- I mean, you read this brief that you

submitted, it gives you kind of a headache.     That -­

that -- you know, and it -- it suggests how difficult

the process is.

And then you look at this provision, and

maybe this provision can be read as an entitlement, but

it can just as easily, as -- as Justice Breyer

suggested, be read as a cap, "no more than 25 percent."

So as between those two possible readings,

the complexity of your way of reading this, which would

have -- why?

MS. O'CONNELL:     Justice Kagan, I'd like to,

if I could, go to the second point, which is on the -­

the -- whether you read this as a 25 percent entitlement

or a cap, and I would like to point the Court, not just

to the language of the Compact, which we think weighs in

favor of the idea that each right -- each State has an

equal right and that the -- the equal right to use the

water in the subbasin implies an equal right, not just

an opportunity.

But the interpretive comments that follow

Section 5.05(b) -- this is at page 30 of the is Joint

Appendix -- refer to a "right."     The first full

paragraph there says, "When the flows" -- I'm sorry,

it's the -- the second line.     "If the States have

competing uses and the amount of water available in

excess of 3,000 cubic feet per second cannot satisfy all

such uses, each State will honor the other State's right

to 25 percent of the excess flow."

The Red River Compact Commission also

approved rules and regulations, and those say -- they're

on page, I think, 19 of the Joint Appendix.     I might

have that page -- yeah, I have that page wrong.

But the -- the Red River Compact

Commission's rules and regulations say that when the

flow is above 12,000 cubic feet per second, so that

Louisiana could get its 3,000 cubic feet per second,

"each of the signatory States shall be entitled to

25 percent of the total runoff in undesignated flow."

So I think it -- it's pretty clear that

based on the -- both the text of the Compact and the

interpretive comments in the rules that the Red River

Compact Commission came up with, that there is not just

that you can take whatever is in your borders even if

that doesn't amount to 25 percent, but -- but that each

State is entitled to 25 percent of the water, and that

if that involves going into another State within this

geographic area that's not defined with respect to State

boundaries, then that is permissible under the Compact.

And as the Petitioner pointed out, when the

States wanted to impose a State boundary restriction in

the Compact, they did so.     There are several subbasins

that span more than one geographic -- or more than one

State, and the Compact in those provisions says that you

And I also don't think that this is going to

be particularly troublesome to administer.     I mean,

there may need to be some further proceedings on that,

but Oklahoma law provides the backdrop for what would

happen when a Texas water user goes in to -- to ask for

a permit to appropriate and divert water from within

Oklahoma.

JUSTICE KAGAN:     And what does that mean?

What would Oklahoma do?

MS. O'CONNELL:     Well, the Oklahoma Water

Resources Board would just apply its normal procedures

and laws to determine whether this particular use of

water could be put to beneficial use.     If -- they would

just apply whatever laws they would apply to any

applicant, regardless of whether they are from Texas or

Oklahoma.

JUSTICE KAGAN:     Well, people keep on saying

that, and I -- I guess I just still don't understand

quite what it means.

MS. O'CONNELL:     Well -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:     I mean, let's say Oklahoma,

the board is sitting there and it gets lots of

applications from Oklahoma users.     And let's say it also

not just one county, it's four counties.     What does

Oklahoma do to -- to decide who gets the water?

MS. O'CONNELL:     Well, I think just as -- as

Petitioner's counsel pointed out, there's a -- a

priority in water law, where whoever submits the

application first would -- would get the water if it's

available and they can put it to beneficial use.

And I -- and I -- the Court shouldn't be

concerned.     I know all -- I know there are amicus briefs

submitted by other Texas entities that would like to

have water from this particular subbasin as well.

They're all part of the same Region C, and they -- I

think they have some way to work it out.     It's not like

they -­

JUSTICE ALITO:     Well, I don't understand

your answer.     If -- if you're correct, wouldn't the

Oklahoma board have to give priority to the Texas

applicants in order to make sure that Texas got its

share of the water?

It couldn't just treat -- it couldn't just

be indifferent as to whether it was an Oklahoma or Texas

applicant.

MS. O'CONNELL:     That -- true, to the extent

that Texas was not receiving its water.     I mean,

under -- under our theory, which we think could be

developed more in the lower courts, if Texas was already

receiving 25 percent of the water, then Oklahoma would

not have to give it any kind of special priority.     But

if it -- if it was not, then the Oklahoma Water

Resources Board would treat it just like an Oklahoma

applicant.

JUSTICE ALITO:     Is it correct that -- that

there are reservoirs in Texas that flow into -- from

which water is released into the Red River?

MS. O'CONNELL:     Yes.

JUSTICE ALITO:     Okay.     And -­

MS. O'CONNELL:     And in Oklahoma as well.

JUSTICE ALITO:     And what if Texas didn't -­

what if Texas could get -- could -- could release that

water and increase the flow of the river, but it chose

not to do so, so it could take other water out of the

river?

MS. O'CONNELL:     This -- this is the last

point made in the Respondent's brief -­

JUSTICE ALITO:     Yes.

MS. O'CONNELL:     -- and -- and the response

to that would just be that all of the States would have

the opportunity to do that.     In fact, the whole subbasin

is defined by the last major dam site on the tributaries

that are running in.     So Oklahoma could do the same

And also, when the reservoirs are full,

they're full.     It's not like Texas could keep all of the

water that's -- that's there from flowing into the

bottom portion of that tributary.

JUSTICE BREYER:     Well, we're only

considering the instance where there isn't enough water

to meet the 25 percent in Texas.     And in that instance,

I guess there are 50,000 places, not just in Oklahoma,

but also in Arkansas, where they might get some.

And all my question, and I think that was

being asked, is there anything else you want to say as

to why that's an easy matter to decide?

MS. O'CONNELL:     Well, I -- it's -- we don't

think it needs to be decided in this particular

proceeding.

I think there are two errors that the Court

of Appeals made in applying a presumption against

preemption and in concluding that a Texas water user

could never divert water from outside of its State.

Those could be developed -- those additional problems

could be dealt with by the Oklahoma Water Resources

Board or as you said, perhaps in the original action.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

MS. BLATT:     Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

If I could just address two sort of factual

questions.

Under the -- the actual Red River Boundary

Compact, the lawyer for Tarrant was wrong.     There's

actually a strip called Shawnee Creek, from the Denison

Dam to the Shawnee Creek, that actually belongs to

Texas.     So there's a piece of the Red River in this very

subbasin that is -- it's in the express Boundary

Compact.

Moreover, all of the Red River and Lake

Texoma that is in Texas is part of the main stem, and

that is not only in the land of Texas, Texas users draw

water, quite a lot of water, from Lake Texoma.     So

that's two places on the main stem.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:     Are they licensed?

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:     So I'm sure -- you're -­

you're saying that the State of Texas can take water

directly from the main stem?

MS. BLATT:     It can and does.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:     That's my point, yes.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:     Anywhere close to of

the 25 percent they claim entitlement to?

MS. BLATT:     Well, who knows?

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:     I was hoping you

did.

(Laughter.)

MS. BLATT:     Who knows?     Texas has more than

a dozen fresh tributaries running from Subbasin 2 and

Subbasin 4.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:     I'm talking about

Subbasin 5.

MS. BLATT:     Subbasin 5, these are all -­

excuse me -- these are tributaries that run into

Subbasin 5.     There is more than a dozen tributaries in

Subbasin 5.

For 30 years no one has ever kept track of

any kind of accounting whatsoever, so when we say, "who

knows," that is the way the drafters -- it's not only

the way the drafters intended, but that has been the

state of play for 30 years.

So nobody -- and in the laws of Louisiana

and Arkansas don't even track diversions.     So -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:     Just to be clear, in your

view, Texas can, without going on Oklahoma property,

take water from the main stem in Basin 5?

MS. BLATT:     In Subbasin 5, there is only up

from Denison Dam east to Shawnee Creek.     So that's just

anywhere from a half a mile to three-quarters.     It runs

from the -- from the middle of the channel.

East -- excuse me, west is Lake Texoma, and

if you want to look at the map, it's a big old lake.

That is a lot of water.     And they definitely do take -­

and that's in the brief -- they take lots of water from

that lake from the Texas side.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:     But my question was, can

they take it from the main stem -­

MS. BLATT:     Only in that -- that little slip

of land to Shawnee Creek.     It's -- it's a part of

Texas -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:     Is that the part that,

under their allegation at least, is saline?

MS. BLATT:     Well, again, they drink the

water in Subbasin 5.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:     All right.     Is that the

part that -­

MS. BLATT:     Yes.     They think -­

MS. BLATT:     Yes.     They think all the water

that their residents drink is salty, but they still are

drinking it.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:     Texans.

MS. BLATT:     They're drinking it.     In fact,

they're -- footnote 3 and footnote 4, their water

planning documents, say this is a -- quite a -- a

drinkable source of water.

JUSTICE SCALIA:     When they -­

MS. BLATT:     I understand they think it's

salty, but they drink it.

JUSTICE SCALIA:     When they take water from

the main stream of the Red River, how do they know how

much of that water is from Reach V?

MS. BLATT:     Well, the -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:     They are -- they are

entitled to -- to no more than 25 percent from Reach V.

Is everything that -- that comes into Texas in the main

channel of the Red River water from Reach V?

MS. BLATT:     So if you look at the -- if you

look at the map in the red brief that's got all the -­

the colors, and the pink is Subbasin 5.     So where they

divert water from is all up and down those blue

tributaries that are in pink south of the Red River.

JUSTICE SCALIA:     Yeah, okay.

MS. BLATT:     -- this map.

JUSTICE SCALIA:     Yeah, yeah, yeah.     I didn't

know -­

MS. BLATT:     So they -- and then if you look

at that -- that blue lake that looks like a dragon, that

is also where they are -- they are taking water.

JUSTICE SCALIA:     What -­

MS. BLATT:     That just happens to be in Reach

I.

JUSTICE SCALIA:     Reach I.     Okay.

MS. BLATT:     But their water planning

documents show that all the water in the pink on the

Texas side is a very valuable source of drinking water.

And if you see, all the way down to Lake Texarkana, they

can -- they are taking that water, too.

And when we say about what we know, no one

has ever done any accounting because the Equal Rights

Clause has always been read as equal rights to the use

of the water without prejudice to or from each other's

State, and, in that sense, it means that if one State

took an earlier use of the water, it wouldn't gain a

priority indefinitely over the other States.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:     Well, it never -- it

never says that.     I mean, that's why we have a case.     It

never says it has to be from your State.

And I appreciate your -- the focus in your

argument on State sovereignty, but this is an interstate

Compact.     And the whole point of interstate compacts is

that we have to -- each State has to give up a little

here or a little there to solve a problem.

So I -- I guess it's -- I don't know why

these basic principles of State sovereignty apply in the

context of an interstate compact.

MS. BLATT:     Right.     I mean, it is our

position that the States would have never agreed to this

extraordinary right without an -- an unequivocal

explicit statement.

But I do think it is absolutely critical to

understand that what they are asking for is

unprecedented, Mr. Chief Justice.     There has never been

a cross-border diversion, ever, under any State water

compact.     And the two examples they cite in their reply

brief are inexplicable -- absolutely inexplicable.     They

cite the Niobrara Compact with no cite.     They -- they

cite the Compact, but they never say there has been a

cross-border diversion.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:     Say that again, because

we have a green brief that gives us samples of

provisions for cross border.

MS. BLATT:     Yeah, under explicit right.

There has never been a cross-border diversion without an

explicit statement.     Not only -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:     Because there have been

many, many -­

MS. BLATT:     Many with explicit statements

and then the essential bells and whistles as to eminent

domain, points of diversion, and which choice of law.

And what they tried to say because we have

been saying all along how unprecedented this would be to

sort of read in silence on borders, they tried to come

up with two examples in their reply brief.

And that's what I'm talking about.     The

reply brief is not only -- is devoid of a citation, but

Nebraska and Wyoming told both us, and Wyoming told

Tarrant's counsel, that there have never been

diversions.     And Nebraska was quite -- like, wow, we

hadn't known that.     And it shows the danger of their

position.     They think if it's silent as to borders, the

State of Wyoming can go hundreds of miles into Nebraska

and take the water across the border.

The other example they cite is fascinating

they argue, there is going to be more than 3,000 feet,

what happens?     And Louisiana would say, we want at least

25 percent, done.     Arkansas, 25 percent, done.

Oklahoma, same, done.     Texas, same, done.

But everybody in the room knows that Texas

could never get more than 12 percent within its borders.

Louisiana would be sitting there with not really

came up with 29 percent.

They -- they double-counted streams.     They

forgot that Subbasin 5 is not only runoff but also rain.

And then -- this one's humorous -- they didn't count the

excess.     So all the -- all the math that they did

favored Texas, so the math didn't come out that way.

But what's interesting about the Tarrant's

view in juxtaposing with the United States' view,

Tarrant's view is it could have all the water, but they

could get all of it still from Oklahoma.     So Louisiana,

Arkansas, and -- and Texas could come take all their

share from Oklahoma, forcing Oklahoma to have to go

south.

Now the United States' view, and this is

I -- they read a border limitation in there.     They say,

look, borders are here, but if Texas really needs it,

you got to let them come in.     That -- that's the United

States.

They definitely -- which I don't understand

their reliance on the Russello principle because they

read borders into this.     Texas has actually disavowed

this view.     Tarrant's disavowed it.     They disavowed it

to the Tenth Circuit when the Tenth Circuit asked for

what their standing would to be to press it.     They said,

we've never claimed this.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:     So what do you think is

the remedy?     Meaning -­

MS. BLATT:     The remedy?

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:     I -- let me just posit

the point, okay?     I understand your point to the Chief

that there's been no proof that Texas doesn't get its

25 percent or that it couldn't get it from the main stem

or somewhere.     I accept that.

But let's, for the hypothetical, say that

there's a major drought and Texas can't get it from its

portion.     What's its remedy?

MS. BLATT:     Okay.     Yeah.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:     So that -- that it's not

getting -­

MS. BLATT:     Okay.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:     -- 25 percent -­

MS. BLATT:     Yeah.     So let's -­

entitles it to.

The Compact no way, no how entitles the parties to equal

25 percent.     It just doesn't say equal rights to a

numerical share.     It doesn't say equal rights to a

numerical quantity.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:     It says, "shall have

equal rights to the use of runoff originating in

Subbasin 5."

MS. BLATT:     Right.     And you and I could have

equal rights to the use of the family car or equal

rights to the use of the highway.     That doesn't tell me

anything about how many hours I can spend on the

highway.

But here's the problem.     The real problem is

with the cap.     Okay?     Their view is that the first

clause gives you an absolute equal right to a fixed

25 percent, no exceptions.     But then you have this

provided clause which does no work for them.     The

provided clause, which says you don't get any more than

25 percent, they are saying, well, by definition, if you

get exactly 25 percent, the State can take no more than

25 percent.     So they actually just sort of combine the

two.

The other -- I hate to point this out

because I -- I feel a lot of affinity for the United

States, but their proof -­

MS. BLATT:     Affinity for them.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:     Oh.

MS. BLATT:     But listen to their proof for

why there's an equal 25 percent.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:     You are representing

Oklahoma.

MS. BLATT:     I am, but I used to work for

them.

They say well, we're guaranteed an equal

25 percent share, and they cite the compliance rules on

page 19.     And entertainingly so, the rules that they

cite just disprove what they said.

The first rule they cite only gave 3 States.

They divided it by 3 instead of 4.     Their view, the

United States' view, is there's a guarantee of

25 percent of any amount that's in excess of 3,000.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:     Well, this is a -- a

perfectly legitimate argument for you to make, but I

want to go back to Justice Sotomayor's question.

At least as I understood it, it's this, I

want you to assume -- I know you don't agree with

Texas a right to 25 percent of the -- of the excess -­

of the water above the cubic foot.

MS. BLATT:     The excess, yeah.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:     I want you to assume that.

Now, wouldn't the Compact be meaningless if Texas

couldn't actually reach that water?

MS. BLATT:     That is -- that is the United

States' view, and they'd have to go above it.     What they

would have to do, which no one else -- no one has

done -- and I think the drafters thought it was

ultimately impossible because of Arkansas and Louisiana,

is call for an accounting and actually figure out what

the total was, figure out what the excess was, divvy up

the 4 shares, do exactly what Tarrant wants I guess to

happen, which has never happened, and it's not clear to

the drafters of the compliance rules that it could in

fact ever happen because of the riparian laws of

Arkansas and Louisiana.

But -- so in other words, if we lost this

case, which is probably why Tarrant is disavowing the

United States' view, is Texas would be in quite of a

pickle trying to prove they couldn't get their

25 percent.     And so I read Tarrant as saying, don't you

dare send us back to try to prove that.     We want to be

able to go whole hog into Oklahoma.

Kagan was talking about, what's on the ground happening,

and why Oklahoma would have never agreed to this type of

cross-border right because what Tarrant is doing is

exploiting Oklahoma's law, which proceeds on the

assumption that water in Oklahoma is a public trust

that's held for the exclusive benefits of Oklahoma.

And there are three ways where Oklahoma

would not have agreed to this, and it would have been

carefully articulated in a Compact.

The first is prior appropriation.     There are

4 Texas entities that have signed up for permits:     The

Upper Trinity, the North Texas Municipal Water District,

Irving and Tarrant.     And poor Oklahoma City got

sandwiched in the middle.     It beat -- it beat Trinity to

the permit office by 24 hours.

And so not surprisingly, it's open season

for Oklahoma water, all of north Texas has come in and

sought a permit and there's priority.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:     But that's the same

problem.     Even if you take within State, all of these

people, if they were applying for water in Texas as

well, there'd be the same issue there.     One of them

would beat the other one.     It's a question of priority.

You're just claiming that everybody from Oklahoma should

have -- well, not absolute priority, but -­

MS. BLATT:     Well, I have two points.     First,

had -- had Oklahoma seen this coming, since they hadn't

heard about this until Tarrant filed its application,

Oklahoma City certainly would have gotten in line

faster.     And second of all, the whole point of this

Compact -- and if you think about your equitable

apportionment doctrines, which whoever gets to the water

first gets a prior -- gets a priority permanently -­

this was the point of the Compact.     Louisiana and

Arkansas wouldn't have to develop their water, Texas and

Oklahoma were much more economically developed States,

and the equal rights prevented a race to the permit

office.

Let me get to the second aspect what's a

problem, and that is, compacts usually spell out the

points of diversion.     The last place Oklahoma would have

picked as the point of diversion is the Kiamichi River,

and Tarrant is saying, not surprisingly, it's the most

desirable.

And the third is the eminent domain.

Eminent domain law in Oklahoma proceeds on the

assumption that those are Oklahomans who got the permit,

and thus can exercise a core sovereign power, and

Tarrant, not surprisingly, would like to come in and do

that.

And none of this is happening with the

normal political checks in Oklahoma.     Oklahoma can't

vote out of office the Tarrant officials.     It cannot

vote out of office the Upper Trinity or the North Texas

Municipal Water District.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:     Ms. Blatt, does Oklahoma

law in any circumstance permit an appropriation of

water -- water in Oklahoma for out-of-State use?

MS. BLATT:     Well, it's -- if it's compacted

water, you have to get legislative approval and -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:     Just here and now, does

Oklahoma ever -­

MS. BLATT:     Yes, it can.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:     -- permit out-of-State

use of its water?

MS. BLATT:     It has not.     It could, but

the -- but Tarrant is correct that there are facial

differences with respect to out-of-State.     So

out-of-State users would have to get the water going

faster, it's subject to a review.     And there's a

statement in there that you need to look and see if

there's a better use for Oklahoma.

Now, I hope you ask them this because I

gather their view is under the dormant Commerce Clause

is all of those laws are constitutional with respect to

99 percent of the Compact, which is it's allocated to -­

to Oklahoma for its free and unrestricted use.     So

they're basically saying there's 1 percent of this

Compact that's unconstitutional.

And not only is it 1 percent, the minute it

drops below 3,000, all of a sudden, it became.     And on

this, we'd like to talk to the Russello principle.     I

also hope you ask them, this is on page 15A of -- 14A of

the 15A brief.     There are border references arbitrarily

and they're missing, they're there.     It's completely

inconsistent.

And this -- their view would make complete

mincemeat out of 4 other provisions of the Compact.     And

ironically, it would march a lot of States into Texas.

But back to (b) -- (b)(2) and 5.05(c) operate identical

in that they're basically downstream delivery, where all

States have to release 40 percent of the water

downstream.     So they -- they're the same.     They're

absolutely identical.

You hold on to 60, you let 40 percent go.

But only (c) contains that border reference.     Only (c)

says, "within their respective States."     And yet even in

(c), it's completely redundant and unnecessary because

you can't release water from without your State.

this?     Where is this?

MS. BLATT:     This is on page 14A and 15A -­

sorry -- of the red brief.     So only (c) says within

their respective States, but (b)(2) is the exact same

functioning provision, and it's missing the border

reference.     And I -- you don't have time now to ask the

United States' view, but I think the United States would

agree with us that if you give this border thing kind of

the magical meaning, borders kind of appear and

disappear with the water flow, which is very strange.

Tarrant thinks that there's some heretofore

unheard of crediting system, but they don't have an

explanation on how (b)(2) and (c) -- but more

importantly, if you could just turn to 9A for just a

minute, which is 402, I want to walk you through this -­

I'm sorry, 401(b).     This is a provision that -- this is

water wholly within Texas.     And you don't have to

understand much to know that Texas keeps 60, Oklahoma

gets 40.

So you have a big chunk of Texas, and Texas

is allocated 60 and Oklahoma is allocated 40.     Now,

under Tarrant's view, because this is silent as to

borders and because Oklahoma is not in this Reach, it's

not actually located within the subbasin, Oklahoma

either is entitled to or has to go get all of its water

from Texas.     And this pattern repeats itself -- this is

on page 41 of our brief -- throughout the Compact, where

the Compact is silent as to borders, and under their

view -- and their Louisiana view is somewhat

entertaining.

I can't tell if they think Louisiana can go

into Oklahoma or has to move one inch up to the border

to take it out as opposed to just waiting, but under

this view -- and again, it repeats itself throughout the

contract -- the State that's not in the basin because

there are no borders and because, I guess under their

view, the only way that Oklahoma to get its water would

be to go into Texas, and that's why they're sort of

taking this bit about, oh, this Russello principle, if

it's here, it must mean -- it must have had

significance, would make a complete mess of the Compact.

If I could also just turn to the remand of

the United States.     I just wanted to make -- to make

three points.     And that is, I do think it is significant

that it's pointed -- it is addressed to a problem that

Texas itself has never asserted.     They're saying well,

poor Texas can't get its water.     And remember, Texas is

upstream, so this sort of poor Texas is only to Texas.

No other State is going to have this problem because the

rest are downstream.

So this you have to be able to get to your

25 percent is a uniquely pro-Texas provision that

apparently at the same time for 20 years of drafting

history when Texas was trying to buy this water, and the

three States were saying, no way, no how, they either

subconsciously or unconsciously or unintentionally

enacted this provision for Texas's benefit.

JUSTICE BREYER:     In Subbasin 1, that's

mostly in Oklahoma, but Texas gets a lot of the water or

the other way around?     It looked to me like Subbasin 1's

MS. BLATT:     No measurements have ever been

taken with respect to this.

JUSTICE BREYER:     Fine.     So that -- I don't

know how that cuts because certainly the people who drew

this must have thought at least in those other

provisions they are going to develop a measurement

system in case of controversy.

MS. BLATT:     Well, there are gauges.     So

they -- I mean, it would not be impossible, although

very expensive.     And just so you know, Section 211, and

in the interpretive comments of 211, the State said the

last thing we want is this accounting because it's

expensive and burdensome.     And Louisiana and Arkansas,

if you look at the minutes, they are complaining because

their laws are not set up for accounting.     They are

just -- they don't do it.

So this was -- this is -- when you talk

about how this cuts, you have 20 years of silence -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:     I -- I don't understand

what you just said, "They're riparian States, so they

don't track diversions."

MS. BLATT:     Okay.     So when you comment -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:     Why does that follow?

MS. BLATT:     Right.     Okay.     So in the -- the

Oklahoma and Texas, in their permitting system, what

they permit, they track how much you take under the

permit.     They measure.

JUSTICE SCALIA:     Okay.

MS. BLATT:     Louisiana, if you are a

landowner, you just draw from the water and it's a -­

it's a voluntary reporting system, so you don't

necessarily have to tell the State how much you took

out.

JUSTICE SCALIA:     Okay.

MS. BLATT:     So one is a permitting system,

and in Louisiana and Arkansas -- and, I think, again,

Arkansas will develop their laws to do better tracking

of diversions.     But again, this would be the problem of

JUSTICE BREYER:     The relevant legal

argument, I think, is look at what you just cited to us

about this Reach in the subbasin.     60 percent goes to

Texas, 40 percent to Oklahoma.

MS. BLATT:     Right.

JUSTICE BREYER:     Okay.     Now, they've never

measured it.     That's because they never fought about it,

I guess.     And now we have a fight.     So why is it any

easier to develop the necessary measuring system

complicated -­

MS. BLATT:     Justice Breyer, the disaster

would be and the affront to sovereignty is throughout

the Compact, not so much the measuring that's a problem.

Oklahoma would be able to insist on crossing Texas's

borders to draw that 40 percent.     And no one has ever,

ever envisioned any of the Compact as not applying

borders.     It's not so much the measurement.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:     Well, I thought that

was what your -- the other side does envision, that it

doesn't -- it's not bound by the borders, but it's bound

by the agreement, the Compact.     Compacts compromise the

individual State sovereignty.     That's the whole point of

them.

MS. BLATT:     Okay.     But if their view -- I

mean, it is that they have to -- again, our view is that

if they had wanted, like all the other cross-border

rights, to allow for an extraordinary right, they would

have made an explicit statement and then spelled out

exactly what that meant, most importantly the point of

diversion.     Here, at most you have silence on the issue.

Now, the government reads into borders

sometimes because they say you do have borders unless

there is a need.     Under Tarrant's view, which I think is

the most jarring and remarkable view, this is all a

borderless common, and every State could have

criss-crossing pipelines into every State because you

don't have an exhaustion requirement.     So Texas, even

though it's got plenty of water in its fresh water

streams and currently uses them, could take their whole

25 percent from Oklahoma.     Oklahoma could take its whole

25 percent from Texas.     Arkansas could come into

Oklahoma -- and that's their view of the world.

And I think the United States thought, no,

that doesn't make too much sense.     Let's at least make

Texas exhaust.

But the provision -- the Compact doesn't say

this.     Again, the United States and Tarrant proceed on

the assumption that there is a numerical share, that

it's equal rights to an exact 25 percent, exact

25 percent.     Well, that's not what it says.     It just

says equal rights to the use subject to a cap, and we

think a cap by limiting the use is not a guarantee that

you can reach the cap, much less that you can cross

borders to reach the cap.

And if I could just make one more sense -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:     Ms. Blatt, the solicitor

general here today spoke of lots of different examples

where the language of entitlement and rights was used.

Do you have a view as -- as to that?

MS. BLATT:     So they -- you mean the two

compliance rules they cited?     They cited -- so they

say -- that's what I was saying that was sort of sad is

because what they cited disproved what they were trying

to assert it for.

So if you -- you don't even have to read

the -- you don't even have to read the compliance rules.

Just read page 19 of their brief.     They say in the same

sentence that we have an equal -- there's an equal right

to one-fourth of an excess above 3,000.     So that means

you take whatever is above 3,000 and divide by four

equally.     And then they cite a provision that only

divides by 3.     And then the next provision they cite

didn't divide the excess, it divided the total water.

I don't know why they -- it's inexplicable.

I can't tell you why they did that.

And the only other thing I want to say on

the extrinsic evidence, and I do think -- if you think

there's any ambiguity in here, which I think there

clearly is, you have 30 years of post ratification,

which the States immediately did long-term water

planning without so mentioning of this right.     And

Tarrant actually offered to buy the same water for

$1.7 billion in 2002, which is a little bit inconsistent

with the notion that they had this right all along.

They just, in 18 months of negotiating history, never

mentioned that they thought they owned the water, they

were actually offering to pay 1.7 million.     And the

amicus brief filed by the Tribes, on page 4, says we

were at the negotiating table and we never heard Tarrant

mention this right.

And the other thing, I do think the water

planning documents are highly significant because not so

much Louisiana and Arkansas, but Oklahoma and Texas take

water planning very seriously because of their prior

appropriation systems.     There are hundreds of thousands

of pages on the Internet and none of them mention this

right.     Again, they cited something in their reply

brief, but if you go look at it, it doesn't come close

to mentioning a right of Subbasin 5.     Again, ironically

it mentioned a portion of Oklahoma where Texas would

have to actually buy the water.

We'd ask you to affirm.     Thank you.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. ROTHFELD:     Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

A couple of points.     First, my friend, Ms.

Blatt, said that it would make mincemeat and a complete

mess out of the Compact to apply its terms as they were

written.     We think that this Compact was negotiated over

a period of 25 years.     If you look at the Joint

Appendix, you will very painfully see that there are

reams and reams of commentary on the -- on the

negotiations.

I think the Court has to assume that when

the drafters of the Compact used language and referred

to State lines in one place and not in another place,

they had some idea of what they were doing and they made

these different choices intentionally.     So I think the

Court simply should read the terms of the Compact -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:     So how do you deal with

all the provisions she was mentioning with respect to

the 60/40 division?     I can't make rhyme or reason of

those provisions that don't use within State boundaries,

but it has to mean that.

MR. ROTHFELD:     Well, I don't think that it

has to mean that.     If Oklahoma wants to enter Texas to

take -- if it makes more sense for them to do it, they

can.     If not, they can just wait for the water to flow

down.

I think one thing which -- which Ms. Blatt

did not address is the practicalities of how Subbasin 5

operates.     If you look at the map that was pointed out

to you, Subbasin 5, which is what we're talking about

here, is a very wide -- hundreds of miles wide, but

extremely narrow.     It's 10 to 20 miles wide -- north to

south for most of its length.

The reason the drafters drew this is because

the States all take -- the assumption was all of the

water in this Subbasin was going to be surplus water,

literally excess water.     The States all take the water

that they want to use outside of Subbasin 5, and so

the -- the allocations that Ms. Blatt was referring to

by Oklahoma are all in Subbasin 1, they are not in

Subbasin 5.     The water that flows into Subbasin 5 is

water that the States assumed was going to be surplus.

And so it would make no sense, having divided this water

evenly between the compacting States, to think that the

drafters would have required a water user in Texas at

the far west end, which would get its portion of the

25 percent share two miles across the border in

Oklahoma, instead to have to go 200 miles to the east to

get it out of Texas.

That is not what the drafters intended to

accomplish by this.     They created, by the plain terms of

the -- of the language, a common pool of water defined

by dam site, not by State line, and gave each State

equal rights to access that water so long as they did

not use more than 25 percent.

Your response to a question which was raised

by Justice Kagan both to me and Ms. Blatt, I think the

practical application of this is very simple.     One

simply has to apply to the permitting authorities,

wherever you're submitting your application from, they

will apply their ordinary standards.     The Oklahoma Water

Resources Board does that now for applications from

within Oklahoma, it can do it just as well for

applications from Texas or other from other States.

And, again, the practicality of this is,

water users are going to want to use water as close to

where they are located as they can.     They're going to go

right across the State line within Subbasin 5 if that's

the place to get the water.     It makes no sense to

require them to go hundreds of miles distant to get it.

Ms. Blatt suggested that we are reading the

25 percent limitation out of the Compact.     I think her

reading reads the equal rights language out of the

Compact.     They read the Subbasin 5 language as being all

capped and no entitlement.     It does two things.     It

gives equal rights to the water, and then says that you

can't take more than 25 percent within your State.     So

it's designed to do two things.     It's designed to give

you an entitlement and to say you can only use

25 percent of it.

And finally, Ms. Blatt raised questions of

-- of sovereignty and political concern.     As the Chief

Justice suggested, this is a Compact that's an agreement

between coordinate sovereigns.     They have decided what

they want to do.     And the thing that gives respect to

sovereignty is to write -- to read the plain language of

the Compact as the framers wrote it.     Again, they spent

25 years writing it.     They took considerable care, as

you can tell if you look at the negotiating history, in

using the words for each provision.     Those words should

be given meaning.

If there are no further questions.
