## 2105-01-23 Big change is how I count tied interruptions. Eliminated separate class for ties.
## Pet must be strictly greater than Res to be called 'Pet' else 'Res'.

## 2015-01-21 I've done some cleanup and rearranging. Notably the creation of DataFrame objects. 
## I now read data for all cases from SCDB and store it. Then the loop over transcripts is really 
## to extract the key features: interruptions, amicus support, and maybe others. But I still have a
## function to get the winners again inside this loop, and I create a factors dictionary of
## key_features tuple that is redundant with the info in the DataFrame. For cleanup later.

## 2015-01-09 Trying to fix the assignment of petitioner and respondent using ordering.

## 2015-01-08 compiled a similar statistic for interruptions to see which side, not which individual, was interrupted most.

## 2015-01-07 compiled word counts for each side. Turns out that if you know who is petitioner, who has more lawyers, 
## and who was interrupted, then knowing who got more words in doesn't tell you anything significant. 
## Possibly because it doesn't matter and possible b/c sample sizes are quite low at that point.

## 2015-01-05 changed pattern matching for finding names of lawyers to allow for whitespace after '.' before '\n'
