 3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:          We'll hear argument

 4   first this morning in Lopez versus Gonzales and

 5   Toledo-Flores versus United States.

 6                Mr. Long.

 7                ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. LONG, JR.

 8                   ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER LOPEZ

 9                MR. LONG:   Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

   the Court:

                A drug-trafficking crime is defined in 18 U.S.

   Code Section 924(c) as any felony punishable under the

   Controlled Substances Act or two other Federal statutes.

   "Punishable" is a key term.           If that word is omitted, the

   remaining phrase, "any felony under the Controlled

   Substances Act," clearly refers to felony violations of

   the Controlled Substances Act.           The parties agree that

   "punishable" means "subject to criminal sanctions."             So, a

   "drug-trafficking crime," under 924(c), is conduct that is

   subject to being punished under the Controlled Substances

   Act.

                State felonies are not, themselves, punishable

   under the Controlled Substances Act.              It is not a Federal

   crime to violate State law.           The defendant's conduct may

   be punishable under both Federal and State law, but a


                                      4



 1   State felony is not a felony punishable under the

 2   Controlled Substances Act.

 3               JUSTICE KENNEDY:          Well, do you agree that if

 4   there were a State conviction for an offense that would

 5   have been punishable under the Federal law, their both

 6   being felonies, that enhancement can apply, in that

 7   instance, and that that does meet the definition?

 8               MR. LONG:    Yes, Justice Kennedy.        Our position

 9   is, if the conduct would violate a felony provision of the

   Controlled Substances Act or one of the other two Federal

   statutes, it then is a drug-trafficking crime under 18

   U.S. Code Section 924(c), and, therefore, it is an

   aggravated felony.

               But there are three additional textual

   indications, in addition to simply the "felony punishable"

   language, that misdemeanor offenses under the Controlled

   Substances Act are not drug-trafficking crimes under

   Section 924(c).   The first one is, there are other

   provisions of Section 924 -- (e), (g), and (k) -- where

   Congress actually used very similar language.          It referred

   to conduct punishable under the Controlled Substances Act

   or the two other statutes, or offenses under the

   Controlled Substances Act or the two other Federal

   statutes.   But then, it added an express reference to

   State offenses, so --


                                      5



 1             JUSTICE SCALIA:       Where --

 2             MR. LONG:    -- the implication is that when

 3   Congress meant to include State offenses, it said so.

 4             JUSTICE SCALIA:       Where are those sections?

 5             MR. LONG:    The -- you can find them; they're in

 6   the appendix to Lopez's blue brief, Justice Scalia --

 7             JUSTICE SCALIA:       Okay.

 8             MR. LONG:    -- and the provisions on (e), (g),

 9   and (k) -- 924 begins on page 3A of the appendix, and (e)

   begins on 5A, and you can pick up -- (g) is on 6A, (k) is

   on 7A.

             JUSTICE SCALIA:       What are the sections -- (b)?

             MR. LONG:    They're subsections (e), (g), and

   (k).

             JUSTICE SCALIA:       All right.

             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:           Well, that doesn't carry

   too much weight, though, because the provision that -- I'm

   looking at (g)(3), "violates any State law relating to any

   controlled substance," can be broader than what's

   punishable under the Federal Controlled Substances --

             MR. LONG:    It --

             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:           -- Act.

             MR. LONG:    It is a bit broader, Mr. Chief

   Justice, but if you look at all of these provisions, the

   implication is clearly that Congress was referring to


                                    6


 1   State law when it meant to include State law.                I mean, the

 2   -- if you looked at (e), for example, there it's a

 3   parallel construction; it's not broader.                I think perhaps

 4   the government would say, "Well, we're talking about

 5   offenses."    That's a little different from a felony, but

 6   "offenses" is actually a broader term.

 7                I'll mention an additional statute, which was

 8   not in the appendix -- 18 U.S. Code Section 3559(c)(2)(H).

 9   This provision -- it's a similar provision; it defines a

   "serious drug offense" as an offense that is punishable

   under the specific sections of the Controlled Substances

   Act, or an offense under State law that, had the offense

   been prosecuted in a court of the United States, would

   have been punishable under the CSA.

                An additional textual indication is, it's agreed

   -- and this Court has already said, in Gonzales against

   the United States, that a drug-trafficking crime under

   924(c), under the criminal statute, must be a Federal

   crime.   924(c)(1)(A) refers to a crime that may be

   prosecuted in a court of the United States, and that

   clearly refers to a Federal crime.                The definition of

   drug-trafficking crime, by its term, says it is for

   purposes of 924(c), so there is no reason why Congress

   would have wanted to include State felonies in a

   definition that applies to a Federal criminal provision


                                      7


 1   that all concede applies only to Federal predicate

 2   offenses.   And --

 3               JUSTICE ALITO:       In --

 4               MR. LONG:    -- the Government's interpretation

 5   would significantly broaden Section 924(c) to include

 6   Federal misdemeanors.

 7               JUSTICE ALITO:       In 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(43)(B),

 8   what, in your view, does the first phrase, "illicit

 9   trafficking in a controlled substance," add to the

   reference to a drug-trafficking crime --

               MR. LONG:    Justice --

               JUSTICE ALITO:       -- as defined by 924(c)?

               MR. LONG:    Justice Alito, in our view, "illicit

   trafficking" means any offense that has a trafficking

   element -- that is, distribution, possession with intent

   to distribute, manufacture --

               JUSTICE ALITO:       But are there any trafficking

   offenses that would not fall within 924(c) if you define a

   "trafficking offense" that way?

               MR. LONG:    Yes.        They're -- most offenses under

   the Controlled Substances Act are trafficking offenses.

   There are a few that are simple possession.          There is a

   date-rape drug that I will not try to pronounce, but it's

   listed in 21 U.S.C. Section --

               JUSTICE ALITO:       Well, no, there --


                                      8


 1              MR. LONG:    -- 844.

 2              JUSTICE ALITO:       -- are possessory -- there are

 3   "mere possession" offenses that are outlawed by 924(c),

 4   but is it not the case that any -- if you interpret

 5   "trafficking" to mean trafficking in the way the word

 6   would be used in ordinary speech -- that any State

 7   trafficking offense you can think of would have a

 8   corresponding felony violation under the Controlled

 9   Substances Act, so that if you read the statute that way,

   the initial phrase is superfluous?

              MR. LONG:    I believe the Government has a

   footnote in their brief where they suggest there are some

   State trafficking offenses that actually do not have a

   parallel in Federal law.      Soliciting, I think, may be one

   of them.   So, I think there are, in fact, some.      And our

   position, of course, is that by adding illicit trafficking

   -- any trafficking offense, State or Federal, whether or

   not it is punishable under the Controlled Substances Act,

   is an aggravated felony.

              JUSTICE ALITO:       Let me ask the same question a

   different way.   If -- since 924(c) includes some "mere

   possession" offenses, and illicit trafficking in a

   controlled substance includes all violations of 924(c),

   doesn't that show that the way Congress used "illicit

   trafficking in a controlled substance" is not in the sense


                                     9



 1   in which the term is used in ordinary speech, but's much

 2   broader, so that it can include "mere possession"

 3   offenses?

 4               MR. LONG:   The -- Justice Alito, there is an

 5   argument -- it's developed in the brief of the American

 6   Bar Association -- that, because illicit trafficking is

 7   the general category, that all the aggravated felonies in

 8   this category should have a trafficking component; and,

 9   therefore, the felonies punishable under the Controlled

   Substances Act that are "simple possession" offenses

   should not, in fact, be included.           That is not an argument

   that we have pressed in our brief.               We read the phrase to

   say "illicit trafficking, including any felony punishable

   under the Controlled Substances Act."              So, I would agree

   with you, to the extent that if it is a felony punishable

   under the Controlled Substances Act, Congress has said, by

   definition, that it is included in the category of illicit

   trafficking.

               JUSTICE BREYER:      But that's ambiguous.          That's

   perfectly ambiguous.    Because, the case of your client, it

   is a felony, and it is punishable under the Controlled

   Substances Act.

               MR. LONG:   Well, Justice Breyer, it is a

   misdemeanor under --

               JUSTICE BREYER:      No, that's --


                                    10



 1             MR. LONG:     -- the Controlled --

 2             JUSTICE BREYER:           -- right.   But it is a felony

 3   under South Dakota law.     And what the statute says -- and

 4   that's the Government's argument -- they say "any felony

 5   punishable under the Controlled Substances Act."         They

 6   don't mean, necessarily, any felony punishable as a felony

 7   under the Controlled Substances Act.

 8             MR. LONG:       Well --

 9             JUSTICE BREYER:        It might mean anything that is

   a --

             MR. LONG:     But --

             JUSTICE BREYER:       -- felony, and --

             MR. LONG:     But --

             JUSTICE BREYER:       -- it is also punishable; in

   which case, you lose.   But, in the first case, you win.

             MR. LONG:     But, you know --

             JUSTICE BREYER:       So, what am I supposed to look

   to, to decide which is --

             MR. LONG:     Well, you could look to the case of

   Jerome against United States, which is -- which was a

   unanimous decision of this Court -- in which the Court

   held that the -- just the phrase "any felony" --

             JUSTICE BREYER:       Uh-huh.

             MR. LONG:     -- in the Federal bankruptcy statute

   should be interpreted to mean any Federal felony, so --


                                   11



 1             JUSTICE BREYER:         Oh, but you don't mean that,

 2   because you're prepared to concede -- at least I thought

 3   you were, until your last argument -- you're prepared to

 4   concede that if a person engages in a crime that is

 5   punishable as a felony under South Dakota law, and it is

 6   also punishable as a felony under Federal law, under 801,

 7   et seq, well, that counts.

 8             MR. LONG:      Well, but, I mean, the Government --

 9             JUSTICE BREYER:         Do you --

             MR. LONG:      -- accuses us --

             JUSTICE BREYER:         Do you concede that --

             MR. LONG:      The --

             JUSTICE BREYER:         -- or not?

             MR. LONG:      The Government accuses us of making

   that concession --

             Justice Breyer:         No, no.

             MR. LONG:      -- but we --

             JUSTICE BREYER:         You --

             MR. LONG:      -- really don't.

             JUSTICE BREYER:         -- you say your answer is, you

   don't make the concession?

             MR. LONG:      We really don't.         I mean, we concede

   that if the -- I mean, 8- -- 924(c), the criminal statute,

   says nothing about State law.            It says nothing about any

   conviction under Federal or State law.            It's simply a


                                     12



 1   question of whether the conduct is punishable, capable of

 2   being punished, under the Controlled Substances Act --

 3              JUSTICE KENNEDY:         But I thought that --

 4              MR. LONG:     -- the Federal statute.

 5              JUSTICE KENNEDY:         -- was the concession you made

 6   in response to my --

 7              MR. LONG:     Well --

 8              JUSTICE KENNEDY:         -- question.

 9              MR. LONG:     -- yes.         I -- but I just want to be

   careful about the language in which we make --

              JUSTICE STEVENS:         But you --

              MR. LONG:    -- this concession --

              JUSTICE STEVENS:         -- make the concession, as I

   understand it, because it's a Federal felony, not because

   it's a State felony --

              MR. LONG:    Right.

              JUSTICE STEVENS:         -- isn't that right?     Yes.

              JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Is it --

              MR. LONG:    Precisely.

              JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Is it -- if this is an

   ambiguous statute, do you -- what mileage do you get from

   Barrett?   There is certainly an argument that what was --

   Congress was trying to do was to codify that practice of

   saying, "If there is analogous felony -- if there is

   analogous crime under State law, that should be included."


                                    13


 1   And that made good sense.

 2             MR. LONG:       Yes.     If it's ambiguous, and you look

 3   to the legislative history, I think we get considerable

 4   mileage from Barrett.      The Congress was pretty clear that

 5   what it was doing was codifying Barrett.                The Barrett

 6   approach, which was then followed by the BIA for more than

 7   a decade, was that they would count State drug crimes, but

 8   only if they were felonies under the Federal statutes,

 9   under the Controlled Substances Act.                So, I think we get

   considerable mileage out of that.

             JUSTICE GINSBURG:               What --

             JUSTICE KENNEDY:            You've --

             JUSTICE GINSBURG:               -- about the --

             JUSTICE KENNEDY:            -- answered Justice Breyer by

   citing the Jerome case.        After Jerome, we decided United

   States vs. Gonzales, having to do with the consecutive or

   concurrent sentencing terms.              And it -- are those two

   cases in some tension?       Gonzales didn't mention Jerome.

   And I noticed that none of the briefs mentioned it either.

   Is there some tension in the cases?                And, if so, is this a

   case where, when we write an opinion, whatever the

   outcome, we should talk about that?                And, if that's so,

   what should we say?

             MR. LONG:       I don't see any tension.            Gonzales

   was just about consecutive versus concurrent sentences


                                      14


 1   under State versus Federal law.            I mean, the Court has

 2   applied that principle --

 3             JUSTICE KENNEDY:            But it does --

 4             MR. LONG:       For example, in Taylor --

 5             JUSTICE KENNEDY:            -- it does seem to limit the

 6   broad statement in Jerome, without mentioning Jerome.

 7             MR. LONG:       Well, but -- I mean, with respect,

 8   Justice Kennedy, I don't see how it limits it.                And there

 9   have been other cases -- Taylor is an example -- where the

   Court adopted a single definition of "burglary" for

   purposes of 924(e).     That applies the Jerome principle.            I

   mean, it's a principle that has been applied in a number

   of this Court's cases.

             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              But has it ever been

   applied in a -- to a statute that specifically says that

   the term "aggravated felony" applies to an offense

   described in this paragraph, whether in violation of

   Federal or State law?

             MR. LONG:       Well --

             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              That would seem to me to

   be a very express legislative repudiation of the Jerome --

             MR. LONG:       Well --

             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              -- principle.

             MR. LONG:       -- when we get to that language, Mr.

   Chief Justice -- and I do think it helps the analysis to


                                      15


 1   first decide, What is the definition of a "drug-

 2   trafficking crime" under 924(c), the criminal statute?

 3   Once you've decided that -- now, when you move back to the

 4   INA, there is this language.             The term "aggravated felony"

 5   applies to an offense described in 101(a)(43), whether in

 6   violation of Federal or State law, or the law of a foreign

 7   country.    Now, we think that's pretty straightforward.             It

 8   has to be an offense described.             So, the simple example is

 9   money laundering.    It -- the offense described in 18 U.S.

   Code Section 1956, "money laundering," is an aggravated

   felony.    So, a violation of State law or of foreign law

   can be an aggravated felony, but only if it is the offense

   described in 1956.    If States or a foreign government has

   a broader definition of "money laundering," that can't

   count, because it's not the offense described.            And when

   you turn to a drug-trafficking crime, the way that offense

   is described in 101(A)(43) is -- Congress picked up, in

   its entirety and without any modification, the definition

   of "drug-trafficking crime" in 924(c), a felony punishable

   under the Controlled Substances Act.

               So, if you agree that, in the criminal statute,

   that means a felony violation of the Controlled Substances

   Act, the offense described is the felonies in the

   Controlled Substances Act, not the felonies in the

   misdemeanors.    And State -- if State law wants to call a


                                     16



 1   -- something that's a misdemeanor under Federal law a

 2   felony, they can do that, but they can't expand the

 3   offense described.    The offense described, the way

 4   Congress did that, is --

 5             JUSTICE STEVENS:            But are you saying it would

 6   also include State trafficking offense, because it's

 7   described in the word "trafficking"?

 8             MR. LONG:      Yes.     I'm focusing on the definition

 9   of "drug-trafficking crime."             It -- also, there's the

   illicit trafficking piece of this.                And, I should add, any

   State offense that is illicit trafficking is going to be

   an aggravated felony.     We recognize that.

             If there are no further questions, I'd like to

   reserve the balance of my time.

             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             Thank you, Mr. Long.

             Mr. Crooks, we'll hear now from you.

                  ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY CROOKS

            ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER TOLEDO-FLORES

             MR. CROOKS:         Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

   please the Court:

             I would first like to address the Government's

   contention that Mr. Toledo-Flores's appeal is moot.               His

   appeal of his sentence is not moot, primarily because he

   is still subject to the sentence that is the subject of

   that appeal.    Even though Mr. Toledo-Flores was released


                                     17



 1   from prison on April 21st of this year, and deported to

 2   Mexico, he's still subject to the supervised-release

 3   portion of his sentence, because supervised release is not

 4   automatically extinguished by deportation.

 5             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:           But there's no

 6   supervised release of people outside the United States.

 7             MR. CROOKS:     There's no supervision of people

 8   outside the United States, Mr. Chief Justice, but he is

 9   still subject to the jurisdiction of the District Court,

   and still subject to the conditions of supervised release

   that are not dependent upon supervision.

             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:           Well, like what?

             MR. CROOKS:     Well, for example, he shall not

   excessively use alcohol, he shall not associate with

   persons who --

             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:           What's going to happen

   to him if he does that?

             MR. CROOKS:     If the District Court learns about

   it he could be violated -- he could be extradited back

   from Mexico, and he could face up to a year more in

   prison.

             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:           Has anything like that

   ever happened before with people subject to supervised

   release who are then deported?         It would be the first

   time, if the District Court did that, right?


                                   18



 1               MR. CROOKS:    There have been instances in the

 2   case law where people on supervised release have been

 3   extradited back from foreign countries based on violations

 4   of their supervised release.            But the point is, under the

 5   statutory scheme, Mr. Toledo-Flores is still subject to

 6   the District Court's jurisdiction.               The District Court

 7   retains jurisdiction to modify his supervised release, to

 8   change the conditions, or to cut the supervised release.

 9   If the District Court learns of a violation and a

   violation warrant is filed within the supervised-release

   period then the supervised-release period is effectively

   tolled and the District Court --

               JUSTICE GINSBURG:           And that --

               MR. CROOKS:    -- retains --

               JUSTICE GINSBURG:           -- that period has how many

   months to run?

               MR. CROOKS:    Until April 20th of next year, Your

   Honor.

               JUSTICE GINSBURG:           Do you -- you said you rely

   primarily on that argument -- do you have another

   argument?

               MR. CROOKS:    Yes, we do, Your Honor.           After

   April 20th, of course, in accordance with this Court's

   decisions in Spencer v. Kemna and Lane v. Williams, the

   Court needs to look for a collateral consequence of the


                                    19


 1   then-expired sentence.      And, in this case, we point to the

 2   possibility that a retrospective reduction in the term of

 3   imprisonment -- which, of course, will not give excess

 4   prison time back to Mr. Toledo-Flores -- but even to

 5   reduce the number of the sentence, on paper, could be a

 6   favorable factor for him to get a waiver of

 7   inadmissibility, should he ever want to get a nonimmigrant

 8   visa in the future to come visit his U.S.-citizen

 9   children.

               JUSTICE SCALIA:       We have a case involving

   standing which says that -- you know, the doctrine of

   standing is more than a -- an exercise in the -- in the

   conceivable.    And this seems to me an exercise in the

   conceivable.    Nobody thinks your client is really, you

   know, abstaining from tequila down in Mexico because he's

   on supervised release in the United States, or is going --

   is going to apply -- having been deported from the country

   for criminal offenses, is going to apply to come back in

   the -- these are ingenious exercises in the conceivable.

   This is just not the real world.

               MR. CROOKS:     Well, my answer to that, Justice

   Scalia, is that this Court has never said that an appeal

   of a sentence may become moot before that sentence is

   expired.    And in cases like Lane v. Williams and Spencer

   v. Kemna, the sentences were completely expired, and,


                                     20



 1   therefore, the Court had to look for collateral

 2   consequences of the now-expired sentence.          Here, in

 3   consequence -- in contrast, Mr. Toledo-Flores is still

 4   under the sentence, which is a direct consequence --

 5             JUSTICE SCALIA:       That depends on whether you

 6   consider the sentence to be effectively expired once he

 7   leaves the country, if the sentence is one of supervised

 8   release, which is impossible once he leaves the country.

 9   Supervision being impossible, supervised release is not a

   realistic consequence of the prior conviction.

             MR. CROOKS:     But that argument could be made

   with respect to a person who is in the United States, who

   is subject to a term of probation where the only condition

   is that he not further violate the law.          In that --

             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:           Well, no, because --

             MR. CROOKS:     -- instance --

             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:           -- in that -- in that

   instance, action can be taken against him if he does

   further violate the law under the terms of probation.          The

   point is that the jurisdiction of the probation office or

   the District Court doesn't extend to Mexico.

             MR. CROOKS:     Well, that's true.        But if we're

   talking about future violations of the law, it is very

   often the case that persons who are deported to Mexico do

   come back, and do have their supervised release --


                                   21



 1                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              Well --

 2                MR. CROOKS:    -- revoked.

 3                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:              -- you don't want to say

 4   that your case is not moot because your client is going to

 5   violate the law again in the future.

 6                MR. CROOKS:    No, not at all, Your Honor, but I'm

 7   saying that, in the respect that you just talked about for

 8   the U.S. citizen, it's not any different, that the court

 9   retains jurisdiction to violate the supervised release,

   and to revoke it, and then to send him back to prison.

                JUSTICE SOUTER:      No, but it is different, in the

   respect that he would first have to violate the law by

   entering the United States.

                MR. CROOKS:    That is true.           But in most cases,

   that is the only violation of supervised release for which

   they are later revoked.       And, in that respect, it would be

   no different from a person who violates his probation by

   driving while intoxicated or committing some other legal

   violation.

                JUSTICE BREYER:      Do you work in --

                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           On --

                JUSTICE BREYER:      -- this area?

                JUSTICE GINSBURG:           On collateral consequences,

   do you have -- what is your best authority to say that in

   -- it would keep this case from being moot?


                                     22


 1             MR. CROOKS:      We cited, in our reply brief at

 2   page 4, Your Honor, the Hamdi case, United States v.

 3   Hamdi, from the Second Circuit, where the Second Circuit

 4   found that the possibility of reducing the term of

 5   imprisonment, even retrospectively, could have an impact

 6   on the ability to get a waiver of inadmissibility in --

 7             JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Because --

 8             MR. CROOKS:      -- the future.

 9             JUSTICE GINSBURG:             Because the length of the

   sentence counts heavily in the attorney general's

   assessment, is that --

             MR. CROOKS:      That's correct, Your Honor.        In

   Hamdi, they pointed out that the length of the sentence

   goes to two of the three factors that are evaluated by

   Immigration officials -- under a decision called Matter of

   Heronka -- that are used in evaluating whether a person

   should be granted a waiver of inadmissibility in the

   discretion of the attorney general --

             JUSTICE SCALIA:        Do you think there's a

   realistic possibility that this person is going to be

   readmitted?   A realistic possibility?

             MR. CROOKS:      I do not know, Your Honor.        He's --

             JUSTICE SCALIA:        Oh.

             MR. CROOKS:      -- got U.S. citizen --

             JUSTICE SCALIA:        Do you think there's a


                                    23


 1   realistic possibility he's going to try to get readmitted,

 2   so that he can be subjected to really enforced supervised

 3   release?

 4              MR. CROOKS:      Well, I think that there is a

 5   possibility that he -- he could qualify for a nonimmigrant

 6   visa at some point --

 7              JUSTICE SCALIA:        Has he applied for such a visa?

 8   Has he expressed any intention to apply?

 9              MR. CROOKS:      He has not, Your Honor, but he does

   have U.S.-citizen --

              JUSTICE SCALIA:        Well --

              MR. CROOKS:      -- children --

              JUSTICE SCALIA:        -- then it's an exercise in the

   conceivable, it seems to me.

              MR. CROOKS:      But this Court has never held that

   a -- it would be unfair to hold that an appeal of a

   sentence can be moot while that sentence is still in

   effect, and when it can still have consequences for Mr.

   Toledo-Flores.    And that's what distinguishes this case

   from all the other cases decided by this Court, is that

   the sentence itself is the concrete and continuing injury

   that defeats --

              JUSTICE STEVENS:          May I --

              MR. CROOKS:      -- mootness in this case.

              JUSTICE STEVENS:          -- ask this question?   It's --


                                     24


 1   presuming -- supposing we say it's not moot, and you

 2   prevail.   Could he be resentenced without being present in

 3   court?

 4              MR. CROOKS:     Yes, he could, Your Honor.     We do

 5   resentencing in absentia all the time in the Southern

 6   District of Texas --

 7              JUSTICE BREYER:       In the Southern --

 8              MR. CROOKS:     -- in circumstances that are

 9   similar.

              JUSTICE BREYER:       In the -- have you ever heard

   of, or had, a client -- or heard of a person from Mexico

   who had been deported because he has been involved in

   drugs, and the Government wants to bring him back because

   he may be a witness -- maybe something develops, some

   other members of the gang are there, they'd like his

   information?

              MR. CROOKS:     That does happen occasionally.

   People are paroled, then, to testify in court proceedings

   or to cooperate with Federal --

              JUSTICE BREYER:       So, if --

              MR. CROOKS:     -- or State --

              JUSTICE BREYER:       -- they pick up some friends of

   his who are engaged in drugs, the Government might decide

   to try to get him back.

              MR. CROOKS:     That's correct, Your Honor.


                                    25


 1               JUSTICE SCALIA:      Is there any indication that

 2   that's in the works, or is this just another conceivable

 3   thing?

 4               MR. CROOKS:    There is no indication in the

 5   record --

 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:      Yes.

 7               MR. CROOKS:    -- that that is in the work.              I do

 8   want to point out that --

 9               JUSTICE BREYER:      Well, it's conceivable, I

   guess, that people will break their parole.              Often it

   doesn't happen; sometimes it does.               Sometimes they want to

   get him back; sometimes they don't.

               MR. CROOKS:    That's all very true, Justice

   Breyer.

               I wanted to point out that, in Campo Serrano,

   which we've cited in our brief, this Court held that a

   deported alien's probation term was a continuing criminal

   sentence that saved the case from mootness.              And the Court

   pointed to the fact that he -- that the deported alien in

   Campo Serrano could, just like Mr. Toledo-Flores, have his

   conditional release revoked, and he could be reimprisoned,

   upon a finding that he had violated his conditions.                 And

   we believe that Campo Serrano points very strongly in the

   direction that this case is not moot.

               On the merits, I would just like to point out


                                    26



 1   that the interpretation that is advanced by the

 2   petitioners here promotes the very sort of uniformity that

 3   this Court has found desirable in cases like Jerome v.

 4   United States and its progeny, including Taylor v. United

 5   States, in that the same conduct of conviction will have

 6   the same immigration and same Federal sentencing

 7   consequences, irrespective of the labels or maximum prison

 8   terms affixed by the particular States that set out that

 9   conduct.   And --

              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             Thank you, Counsel.

              MR. CROOKS:       Thank you.

              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:             Mr. Kneedler.

               ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

                       ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

              MR. KNEEDLER:        Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

   please the Court:

              In order for a State drug offense to be an

   aggravated felony under Section 1101(a)(43)(B) of the INA,

   two -- there are two requirements.                 The underlying conduct

   must be punishable under the Controlled Substances Act or

   one of the other specified Federal statutes, and it must

   be a felony.

              Because Petitioner's underlying conduct here was

   punishable under the Controlled Substances Act, and was a

   felony under State law, they are -- they were properly


                                      27


 1   found to have committed aggravated felonies.                 That

 2   conclusion follows, not just from Section 924(c), but,

 3   more importantly, by the fact that what is relevant here

 4   is, What is the meaning of 1101(a)(43), which is the

 5   operative provision, which just happens to incorporate the

 6   definition of "drug-trafficking crime" from 924(c)?                   And

 7   there are three features of 1101(a)(43) with --

 8                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:         Why don't you say "it just

 9   happens"?     I mean --

                 MR. KNEEDLER:     No.       No.      But -- no, but -- yes.

   No, it's --

                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:         -- it's there in the statute.

                 MR. KNEEDLER:     It's -- I'm sorry.

                 JUSTICE KENNEDY:         That's why you're here.

                 MR. KNEEDLER:     It expressly incorporates it,

   yes.   Yes.    But the -- but the operative provision is

   section 1101(a)(43) of the INA, and there are three

   features of that that we think reinforce this conclusion.

   The first is that the consequences of aggravated felony

   status under the INA turn on whether one is convicted, not

   whether they have committed the crime, and that's true

   both with respect to the enhancement of sentences under

   1326 and the -- and the immigration consequences.                   And we

   think it makes particular sense when you're talking about

   a conviction to look about how the -- to look at how the


                                      28



 1   crime is treated under the jurisdiction of conviction.

 2                JUSTICE SCALIA:      I thought the Government has

 3   taken the position -- and as far as I know, all the Courts

 4   of Appeals have bought the Government's argument -- that

 5   there -- you do not need a conviction --

 6                MR. KNEEDLER:     You do --

 7                JUSTICE SCALIA:      -- that so --

 8                MR. KNEEDLER:     -- not need a conviction under

 9   Section 924 if you're bringing a prosecution under Section

   924(c).

                JUSTICE SCALIA:      Yes.      You don't --

                MR. KNEEDLER:     You do not -- you do not need a

   conviction.    But, in order -- the immigration consequences

   --

                JUSTICE SCALIA:      Yes, but --

                MR. KNEEDLER:     -- have been --

                JUSTICE SCALIA:      -- but 924(c) is incorporated

   in 1101(a)(43).    It's --

                MR. KNEEDLER:     Right.

                JUSTICE SCALIA:      -- incorporated.         So, you want

   us to interpret 924(c) one way for criminal convictions --

   a criminal sentence -- that is, you don't need a

   conviction in order to get the enhancement -- but another

   way for --

                MR. KNEEDLER:     No.


                                     29



 1             JUSTICE SCALIA:         -- for the INA?

 2             MR. KNEEDLER:        Our point is not that 924(c)

 3   requires a conviction when it's in the Immigration Act,

 4   it's that the immigration consequences of that

 5   incorporation turn on whether someone was convicted of an

 6   aggravated felony.

 7             JUSTICE SCALIA:         Why is --

 8             MR. KNEEDLER:        So --

 9             JUSTICE SCALIA:         -- that?

             MR. KNEEDLER:        Well, the ground of deportation

   that refers to "aggravated felony" refers to someone who

   has been convicted of an aggravated felony.                The

   ineligibility for cancellation of removal turns on whether

   someone has been convicted of an aggravated felony, and

   the enhanced penalties under Section 1326 for someone

   whose illegal reentry, following aggravated felony, is for

   a conviction for an aggravated felony.             So, my point is

   that, under the INA, the consequences turn on conviction,

   and it makes sense to look at the jurisdiction of

   conviction -- here, State law -- to see whether it -- to

   look at the -- to determine the status of the crime.             And

   since State law determines it to be a felony, that's the

   --

             JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Mr. Kneedler --

             MR. KNEEDLER:        -- proper place to look.


                                     30



 1              JUSTICE GINSBURG:            -- if there is room for more

 2   than one construction of this statute, it seems to me

 3   unseemly, in the immigration context, to say that two

 4   people who have committed the identical acts, one of them

 5   is barred from ever coming back, doesn't have any of the

 6   dispensations, and the other does, because of the

 7   happenstance of the State in which they were convicted.

 8   That kind of disuniformity in an area where the

 9   Constitution expressly charges Congress with authority to

   make uniform laws, it's -- doesn't that uniform-law

   specification in the Constitution tug in the direction of

   the interpretation that Mr. Long was --

              MR. KNEEDLER:      No, we --

              JUSTICE GINSBURG:            -- presenting to us?

              MR. KNEEDLER:      -- we think it does, for several

   reasons.   First, with respect to the constitutional

   requirement, the uniformity provision applies to uniform

   rules of naturalization; that is, citizenship.            This --

   we're not talking about citizenship here, we're talking --

   we're talking about the eligibility of aliens to remain in

   the country.   Beyond that, even where the Uniformity

   Clause applies -- and there's, for example, a parallel

   Uniformity Clause for bankruptcy -- that's never been

   interpreted to mean that consequences of certain conduct

   under State law can have no impact on bankruptcy law, and


                                    31



 1   that there can't be a variation.             The State-law homestead

 2   exemption under the -- under the bankruptcy laws is a good

 3   example of that.

 4             But, going beyond that, with respect to the

 5   issue of uniformity generally, Congress has established

 6   uniform standards in Section 1101, either in terms of

 7   identifying the conduct in certain instances; in other

 8   instances, by identifying the minimum sentence that was

 9   actually imposed.     In this case, we think, with respect to

   drug-trafficking crimes, it -- it's imposed a uniform

   standard, in terms of the length of the sentence; it has

   to be a felony.     That's -- that is uniformity.

             But the -- to answer your point more directly,

   it is a principle throughout 1101(a)(43) that one looks to

   State law, not to -- not to a -- some supposed uniform

   standard of Federal law.        And, for example, if you --

   several subparagraphs -- and if you'll -- 1101(a)(43) is

   set out at page 12(a) of the appendix to our brief --

   three subparagraphs -- (j), (q), and (t) -- refer to the

   sentence that may be imposed for a violation.            Well, when

   you're talking about a State conviction, that's clearly

   referring to the sentence that may be imposed under State

   law for a conviction.      Four other subparagraphs -- (f),

   (g), (r), and (s) -- turn on the sentence that was

   actually imposed.     That means that -- in the case of a


                                      32



 1   State   crime, as we have here, that State law has to

 2   authorize the sentence, and that the State Court, applying

 3   State sentencing principles, has actually imposed a crime

 4   of -- for -- of at least 1 year.           So, it is -- it is

 5   infused in Section 1101(a)(43) that, in fact, you do look

 6   to the consequences of an offense under State law.

 7              JUSTICE BREYER:       I'm prepared to accept perfect

 8   ambiguity here, linguistically.          And I thought of an

 9   empirical question, that you may know the answer to, that

   might shed some light.

              Now, going along the way -- maybe I'm making a

   mistake to point it out, if I am -- but I go to the key

   thing here, which is the words in 924(c), What is a

   "drug-trafficking crime"?       A "drug-trafficking crime" is a

   crime -- "any felony punishable under the Controlled

   Substances Act."   That could mean an act, physically, that

   is a felony under some law, and is also punishable under

   the Controlled Substances Act as a misdemeanor.           Okay?

   Felony under -- it could pick that up.           And it also could

   mean any conduct which is punishable as a felony under the

   Controlled Substances Act.       And I could look at those

   words a thousand times and not have a clue which it means.

              So, I thought of an empirical test.           This

   statute, 924(c), happens to be a statute that, if you

   engage in a drug-trafficking crime, as defined, and you


                                    33



 1   have a gun with you, you get mandatory 5 years.        That's

 2   the point of it.     And the Government does all the

 3   prosecuting.     So, in how many cases where a person

 4   committed a misdemeanor offense, simple possession, and

 5   had a gun, did the Government insist that they get the 5-

 6   years minimum?     Now, if you're prepared to tell me "a lot

 7   of 'em," I'm prepared to tell you, the Government has

 8   consistently interpreted the statute the way you are now.

 9   But if you're prepared to tell me "zero," I would say I

   would be suspicious of an interpretation that comes along

   now for the first time.        And my mind is open on it.   I'm

   quite interested in the answer.

              MR. KNEEDLER:        To my knowledge, we have not

   brought crime -- prosecutions under 924(c)(1), based on

   the circumstances you posit, but that's --

              JUSTICE BREYER:         But if --

              MR. KNEEDLER:        -- but I don't think that that

   goes very far with respect to answering this question.

   For one thing, as this Court pointed out in the Gonzales

   decision, the requirement that there be a Federal crime,

   and, therefore, a Federal felony under 924(c)(2), comes

   from the language in 924(c)(1) that says that the crime

   must be subject to prosecution in a court of the United

   States.   And this Court, in Gonzales, said it's that

   language that renders the -- renders it a requirement that


                                      34



 1   it be a Federal crime.    The definition of --

 2             JUSTICE BREYER:       No, no.         We both agree.   All --

 3   everybody agrees here.    It doesn't have to be a Federal

 4   crime.

 5             MR. KNEEDLER:      It doesn't have to be --

 6             JUSTICE BREYER:       And --

 7             MR. KNEEDLER:      -- under 1101 --

 8             JUSTICE BREYER:       Correct, it doesn't have --

 9             MR. KNEEDLER:      Right.

             JUSTICE BREYER:       -- to be.        It could be conduct

   that violates the State law, but -- and punish it under

   the State law -- but the conduct involved would have to

   constitute what is a felony under the Controlled

   Substances --

             MR. KNEEDLER:      Would have to --

             JUSTICE BREYER:       -- Act.

             MR. KNEEDLER:      -- in our view, it would have to

   constitute --

             JUSTICE BREYER:       A felony or a misdemeanor.

             MR. KNEEDLER:      -- it would have to be punishable

   under the Controlled Substances --

             JUSTICE BREYER:       Yes.

             MR. KNEEDLER:      -- Act.

             JUSTICE BREYER:       All right.

             MR. KNEEDLER:      But the important point here is


                                   35


 1   --

 2              JUSTICE BREYER:       All right.      So, I say it's

 3   suspicious.

 4              MR. KNEEDLER:      But the question is not what

 5   924(c)(2) means, standing alone or in the abstract; it's

 6   what it means, as incorporated into 1101(a)(43).           And --

 7              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:           And, of --

 8              MR. KNEEDLER:      -- there --

 9              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:           -- course, that's --

   when you get to that, it must give you pause that your

   analysis is of a term, "drug-trafficking crime" or

   "illicit trafficking," and your theory leads to the

   conclusion that simple possession equates with drug

   trafficking.

              MR. KNEEDLER:      Well, the Petitioner has

   conceded, as I understand it -- I heard Mr. Long, I think,

   concede -- that possession offenses can constitute

   aggravated felonies under this provision, that there is

   the recidivist possession, there is the possession of the

   date-rape drug, there is possession of 5 grams or more of

   cocaine.   All of those are specified as being -- of being

   felonies under the -- under 940 -- or 844.          But, beyond

   that, it's important to take into account that a lot of

   State statutes dealing with drugs do not -- are not

   patterned directly after the Federal statute, and there's


                                    36



 1   no reason why Congress would have insisted that they do so

 2   in order for this statute to operate sensibly.           And one

 3   notable example, for instance, is, when it comes to

 4   possession of a substantial amount of drugs, that that

 5   certainly would create a strong implication that the

 6   defendant was engaged in trafficking activities, or

 7   intended to.

 8             The Federal statute deals with that by making it

 9   a felony to possess with intent to distribute the drug.              A

   number of States don't do that.           They, instead, have

   graduated possession offenses, based on the quantity of

   drugs that the defendant is possessing; that above a

   certain quantity of drugs, it would be a felony.           They're

   getting at the same problem, but they've come at it in a

   different way.

             JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Then, in those cases, you can

   say the conduct would constitute a felony under the

   Federal statute; but here, if I recall correctly, the

   amount involved would not have qualified for possession

   with intent to distribute, under Federal law.

             MR. KNEEDLER:      Well, it would always be up to

   the jury to decide that.     Now, in Mr. Lopez's case, he was

   -- he was initially charged with a series of offenses that

   went beyond the aiding and abetting of possession that he

   ultimately pleaded guilty to, but, as he testified in his


                                   37


 1   -- in his immigration hearing, his aiding and abetting of

 2   possession was assisting someone in purchasing drugs,

 3   which was, itself, a trafficking element.           And so, this

 4   shows that the way the State crimes are defined or applied

 5   are often getting at what Federal law --

 6              JUSTICE STEVENS:          Yes.   We have a case in which

 7   we're assuming, for our purposes, we just have possession.

 8   I mean, I understand the facts of this case.           And I wanted

 9   to ask -- I have two questions, Mr. Kneedler.           One of them

   -- the second one, I'd ask that -- you were going to

   mention three different points, one about conviction; you

   had two other points you didn't get to.          I want to learn

   what those were.   But, before that, it seems to me that,

   when you put the whole statute -- all the -- all the

   different statutory provisions together, you really boil

   down and focus on 924(c)(2) and the words "for purpose of

   this subsection, the term 'drug-trafficking crime' means

   any felony punishable under the Controlled Substances

   Act."   And if the word "Federal" had been inserted before

   the word "felony" in the statute, would that not make the

   statute perfectly clear?

              MR. KNEEDLER:      It probably would, but I think

   it's interesting that the version of 924(c) that was in

   effect prior to 1988 said exactly that.          It said "felony

   violation of Federal law."


                                    38



 1              JUSTICE STEVENS:         It was a question of --

 2              MR. KNEEDLER:      It was -- it was explicit.

 3              JUSTICE STEVENS:         -- whether the change was

 4   intended to be --

 5              MR. KNEEDLER:      Well, but --

 6              JUSTICE STEVENS:         -- substantive --

 7              MR. KNEEDLER:      -- Congress --

 8              JUSTICE STEVENS:         -- or merely --

 9              MR. KNEEDLER:      But --

              JUSTICE STEVENS:         -- stylistic.

              MR. KNEEDLER:      -- Congress did change it, in the

   1988 Act, but it did it -- and this is significant -- it

   did it in connection with two changes in the immigration

   law.   One is the enactment of the definition of

   "aggravated felony," which, as I have explained, the

   definition of "aggravated felony" looks to State law, in a

   number of respects, in terms of the severity of the

   offense or the punishment actually imposed.           That was one

   change.

              The other change that was made in the 1988 Act

   was to amend Section 1326 with respect to illegal

   reentries, and it did that by enhancing the penalty for

   conviction of any felony other than an aggravated felony,

   and an aggravated felony.       And certainly the conviction of

   any felony includes State law offenses in this --


                                    39


 1              JUSTICE STEVENS:          Just again, Mr. Kneedler --

 2   focusing again on that specific language, you're saying,

 3   in effect, that that phrase means any State or Federal

 4   felony punishable under the Federal statutes.

 5              MR. KNEEDLER:       It says -- yes, it says "any

 6   felony."   And that is our -- doing it -- and what --

 7              JUSTICE STEVENS:          And is it ever true that a

 8   State felony is punishable under a Federal statute?

 9              MR. KNEEDLER:       The conduct is --

              JUSTICE STEVENS:          Yes, I know, but --

              MR. KNEEDLER:       -- punishable.     The conduct is

   punishable, not --

              JUSTICE STEVENS:          -- but do you know of any

   instance where we've said a State felony is punishable

   under a Federal statute?

              MR. KNEEDLER:       I think not -- I think not used

   in that sense, but I think it's important -- it's

   important to look at the language, as a whole.          It does

   not say "punishable as a felony under" --

              JUSTICE STEVENS:          But you do agree --

              MR. KNEEDLER:       -- "under the Controlled" --

              JUSTICE STEVENS:          -- that the key to the case is

   how we read that one sentence.

              MR. KNEEDLER:       Well, no, I agree that the -- I --

   in my view, the key to the case is in 1101(a)(43),


                                     40


 1   because, if you look at the structure of 1101(a)(43) --

 2   and this gets to the question you -- you said -- you

 3   mentioned that I had three reasons.              One is that under the

 4   -- under the INA, the conviction consequences turn on the

 5   conviction of an aggravated felony, and it only makes

 6   sense to look at the jurisdiction of conviction to

 7   determine the nature of the crime, whether it's a felony.

 8             JUSTICE SCALIA:        Well, but you don't -- you

 9   don't look to the jurisdiction of conviction.              Are you

   telling me you require a conviction?             You -- I thought you

   told me you don't require a conviction.

             MR. KNEEDLER:       No.       Under 924(c), you don't.

   But under the -- under the -- if you're bringing a Federal

   prosecution under 924(c), the term "aggravated felony" has

   no role in that determination.          It is a -- it is a

   separate Federal crime.      We're talking about, here, the

   consequences of -- the consequences of being an aggravated

   felon under 1101(a)(43) are, Where does the definition of

   "aggravated felony" apply?       It only applies under the INA

   if someone has been convicted of an aggravated felony.

   You're only -- you're only subject to deportation for

   aggravated felony if you've been convicted, you're

   ineligible for cancellation or removal, you're subject to

   sentence enhancement.     All those things follow on

   conviction.   And we think it only makes sense to look to


                                    41



 1   the jurisdiction of conviction.         That is --

 2             JUSTICE SOUTER:       All right, Mr. Kneedler,

 3   assuming that -- as I understand it, the answer you just

 4   gave, your second point, as well as the point that you and

 5   Justice Stevens were debating, turns, in your view, on a

 6   definition, or a reading, of the statute that would work

 7   this way: that if, under State law, the act were a felony,

 8   but, under Federal law, the action was merely a

 9   misdemeanor, it would still, for purposes of this

   definition, be an aggravated felony.

             MR. KNEEDLER:      That's correct.

             JUSTICE SOUTER:       That -- isn't that very

   strange, that Congress would have wanted a reading of the

   statute that would turn its definition of a "misdemeanor

   crime" into an aggravated felony for purposes of the

   immigration law?

             MR. KNEEDLER:      I don't think so at all.     And for

   one -- for one thing -- as I've mentioned, the structure

   of the act, as a whole, of 1101(a)(43) -- and there are

   numerous subsections -- look to how the crime -- what the

   authorized punishment was, or look to how the person was

   actually sentenced under State law, not under Federal law.

             JUSTICE SOUTER:          No, but I'm --

             MR. KNEEDLER:      And I --

             JUSTICE SOUTER:       -- saying, if --


                                   42


 1             MR. KNEEDLER:      No -- I --

 2             JUSTICE SOUTER:       No, go ahead.

 3             MR. KNEEDLER:      I also haven't mentioned the

 4   explicit provision, that one of the other Justices

 5   mentioned earlier -- I think, the Chief Justice -- that

 6   the penultimate sentence of 1101(a)(43) says that

 7   something -- a -- an offense constitutes an aggravated

 8   felony, whether in violation of Federal or State laws.

 9             JUSTICE SOUTER:       Well --

             MR. KNEEDLER:      So --

             JUSTICE SOUTER:       -- I know it says that, but

   that doesn't necessarily take you any further than saying

   that if the words of the statute refer to something that

   could be a State law felony, under the -- under the

   penultimate sentence, it will count.            It does not

   necessarily answer the question that we have, and that is

   whether a particular reference in the statute is a

   reference to a Federal felony or a State felony.              So, it

   has a -- the penultimate sentence has work to do.              And, in

   fact, we can see the work being done in the -- in the very

   definition of "drug trafficking" -- but it doesn't

   necessarily lead to the conclusion that you draw from it.

             MR. KNEEDLER:      Well, we think -- we think it is

   quite a -- we think it's a strong confirmation of the

   pattern in 1101(a)(43), that the statute looks to what


                                   43



 1   happened in State Court, and the State punishment that was

 2   authorized there, and the express mention of that -- or --

 3             JUSTICE SOUTER:           Even when --

 4             MR. KNEEDLER:          -- requirement.

 5             JUSTICE SOUTER:           -- the consequence, in effect,

 6   is to turn for -- turn the gravity of the Federal

 7   misdemeanor into the gravity of --

 8             MR. KNEEDLER:          But the --

 9             JUSTICE SOUTER:           -- a felony that --

             MR. KNEEDLER:          -- the Federal Controlled --

             JUSTICE SOUTER:           -- just happens to be a State

   felony.

             MR. KNEEDLER:          The Federal Controlled Substances

   Act does not occupy the field of drug control in the

   country, any more than any other Federal crime occupies

   that field.   And --

             JUSTICE SOUTER:           No, I realize that.   But, if

   we're asking, "What is important in the mind of Congress,

   for purposes of the immigration law?" one would suppose

   that the most obvious touchstone of importance is the way

   Federal law deals with it -- i.e., in the case of a crime,

   whether Federal law calls it a felony or Federal law calls

   it a misdemeanor.   You know, in your reading, when Federal

   law calls it a misdemeanor, if State law calls it a

   felony, it becomes a Federal felony for the immigration


                                       44


 1   law.   And that's what seems to me odd.

 2              MR. KNEEDLER:       Right.       And this is not the only

 3   place where that consequence can arise.            There are --

 4   there are cases involving "What's a crime of violence?"

 5   which is -- which, under subparagraph (g), is another

 6   aggravated felony.    The crime of violence is defined in 18

 7   U.S.C. Section 16, subsection (b) of that -- this Court

 8   considered that statute in Leocal -- requires that the

 9   offense be a felony which creates a serious risk of

   physical harm.    The courts have looked to the State law of

   conviction to determine whether something is a felony --

              JUSTICE SCALIA:        Mr. Kneedler, could --

              JUSTICE SOUTER:        Yes, but --

              MR. KNEEDLER:       -- under that provision.

              JUSTICE SOUTER:        May I just ask one --

              JUSTICE SCALIA:        Sure.

              JUSTICE SOUTER:        It's one thing to turn to State

   law to get an answer where there is no other answer.              The

   problem here is that State law and Federal law are at odds

   in determining the gravity of the offense.           The Federal

   law, on my hypothesis, would say, "It is minor; it's just

   a misdemeanor."    The State says, "No, it is a felony."           It

   seems to me very odd, given the tension between the State

   and Federal classifications, to say that, for Federal

   purposes, the State classification is going to trump the


                                     45


 1   Federal classification; and that's a different situation

 2   from the one you posit.

 3               MR. KNEEDLER:       Well, and -- if I could just

 4   mention one other -- on other example, under the theft-

 5   offense category in subsection -- I think it's (f) --

 6   where a theft offense is deemed to be an aggravated felony

 7   if a sentence of at least 1 year was imposed.            There are

 8   misdemeanor offenses there that -- as a matter of Federal

 9   law, it can be a misdemeanor for certain types of theft

   offenses; and yet, they are covered as aggravated

   felonies.   And, again, that would --

               JUSTICE SCALIA:        Mr. Kneedler, could I ask you

   about your assertion that you "look to the State of

   conviction"?     What do you mean by that?         For purposes of

   1101.   Does that mean, if you're convicted, in State

   court, of a misdemeanor -- and even though that action

   would be a Federal felony, it's not an aggravated felony?

               MR. KNEEDLER:       That is our position, yes.

   Because the requirement -- the --

               JUSTICE SCALIA:        So, it's sort of a double

   inconsistency.     Not only do you treat State -- State

   actions that are -- that are minimal -- I'm sorry, where

   the State treats it more seriously than the Federal

   Government, not only do you follow the State, but, where

   the State treats it less leniently than the Federal


                                      46



 1   Government, you also follow the State.

 2               MR. KNEEDLER:     Well, and --

 3               JUSTICE SCALIA:      Is that right?

 4               MR. KNEEDLER:     Yes.      And we -- yes.   We think

 5   that's --

 6               JUSTICE SCALIA:      So, you look to the State of

 7   conviction.   What --

 8               MR. KNEEDLER:     that's --

 9               JUSTICE SCALIA:      That's for purposes of the

   immigration law.

               MR. KNEEDLER:     Of the immigration law.       And,

   again, we think that --

               JUSTICE SCALIA:      Okay.      Now, do you do the same

   for purposes of the felony enhancement provision?

               MR. KNEEDLER:     924(c)?       No, you don't, because --

               JUSTICE SCALIA:      You --

               MR. KNEEDLER:     -- the aggravated-felony question

   has no -- has no -- the "aggravated felony" term has no

   operative significance under 924 --

               JUSTICE SCALIA:      Well, that seems to me --

               MR. KNEEDLER:     -- itself.

               JUSTICE SCALIA:      -- very strange.      You would

   look to the -- you would look to the State law for

   purposes of the immigration section; but, for purposes of

   924(c), what would you look to?          Either one.   Either one.


                                    47


 1   Whichever --

 2             MR. KNEEDLER:      No, 924 --

 3             JUSTICE SCALIA:       -- whichever -- for 924 --

 4   whichever one would make it a felony.

 5             MR. KNEEDLER:      No, under --

 6             JUSTICE SCALIA:       You lose.

 7             MR. KNEEDLER:      -- under 924(c)(1), this Court --

 8   this Court, in the Gonzales case, said that it -- that it

 9   has to be a Federal crime, but not because of the --

             JUSTICE SCALIA:       Yes.

             MR. KNEEDLER:      -- definition in --

             JUSTICE SCALIA:       Right.

             MR. KNEEDLER:      -- 924(c)(2) --

             JUSTICE SCALIA:       All right.

             MR. KNEEDLER:      -- but --

             JUSTICE SCALIA:       If it's a felony under either

   one, for purposes of 924(c), you lose, right?

             MR. KNEEDLER:      I don't think I --

             JUSTICE SCALIA:       If the act is either a State

   felony or a Federal felony, you lose.           I mean, the

   defendant gets the enhanced sentence, right, under 924(c)?

             MR. KNEEDLER:      No.

             JUSTICE SCALIA:       No?

             MR. KNEEDLER:      Under 924(c), the cases that have

   been brought have all been situations where it is a


                                   48


 1   Federal offense.   But, because -- not because of the

 2   language in 924(c)(2) --

 3             JUSTICE SCALIA:        Well --

 4             MR. KNEEDLER:       -- but because of the -- of the

 5   language --

 6             JUSTICE SCALIA:        Listen.

 7             MR. KNEEDLER:       -- in 924(c)(1).

 8             JUSTICE SCALIA:        Listen.         My question is a

 9   simple one.   If it's -- it seems to me, if it's -- what

   you're saying is, if it is either a felony under Federal

   law or a felony under State law, you get the enhanced

   sentence under 924(c), isn't that right?

             MR. KNEEDLER:       I -- my understanding of the way

   924(c)(1) has operated is that if it is a misdemeanor

   under Federal law, but maybe it would be a Federal felony,

   it would not be -- it would not give rise to the

   enhancement, because it is not a --

             JUSTICE SCALIA:        I thought that's --

             MR. KNEEDLER:       -- it --

             JUSTICE SCALIA:        -- what the whole argument is

   about, whether it has to be a felony under Federal law.

   You're telling me, if it's a misdemeanor under Federal

   law, that you don't get --

             MR. KNEEDLER:       But not --

             JUSTICE SCALIA:        -- the enhanced sentence?


                                    49



 1               MR. KNEEDLER:       -- but not under -- not under

 2   924(c)(2) --

 3               JUSTICE BREYER:        But why not?

 4               MR. KNEEDLER:       -- the definitional --

 5               JUSTICE SCALIA:        You've thoroughly confused me

 6   now.

 7               JUSTICE BREYER:        But 924(c)(1) says that if you

 8   have a gun, and you have a drug-trafficking crime, book, 5

 9   years.

               Okay, now we go to two, what's a "drug-

   trafficking crime"?      It means any felony punishable under

   the -- under the Controlled Substances Act.             Now, in your

   definition, we first look to see whether simple possession

   is punishable under the -- in Controlled Substances Act.

   It sure is.    It sure is.      It's punishable as a

   misdemeanor.    So, it meets that.           Under your definition,

   is it a felony?    Yup, it's a felony in South Dakota.

   Okay.    So, now we've got a prosecution, in Federal Court

   in South Dakota.    And, on your reading of the statute,

   that guy should get a bump-up of 5 years.

               MR. KNEEDLER:       No, that is not our reading of

   the statute.    The --

               JUSTICE BREYER:        Because?

               MR. KNEEDLER:       The only thing that is

   incorporated into 1101(a)(43) is the definition in (c)(2)


                                      50



 1   -- not (c)(1), the definition of --

 2             JUSTICE BREYER:       Yes.

 3             MR. KNEEDLER:      -- of "drug-trafficking crime" in

 4   (c)(2), which says --

 5             JUSTICE BREYER:       Yes.

 6             MR. KNEEDLER:      -- "felony punishable under the

 7   Controlled" --

 8             JUSTICE BREYER:       Right.

 9             MR. KNEEDLER:      -- "Substances Act."

             JUSTICE BREYER:       Right.

             MR. KNEEDLER:      That is what gets plugged into --

             JUSTICE BREYER:       That's correct.

             MR. KNEEDLER:      -- 1101(a)- --

             JUSTICE BREYER:       Right.

             MR. KNEEDLER:      -- -(43).

             JUSTICE BREYER:       Right.

             MR. KNEEDLER:      Along with all of the other

   provisions in 1101(a)(43), you look to State law, in the

   case of a State offense -- the State of conviction, the

   jurisdiction --

             JUSTICE BREYER:       Yes.

             MR. KNEEDLER:      -- of conviction -- to determine

   the nature of the crime.

             JUSTICE BREYER:       But you still have to know

   whether that word, "felony," in (2) means "any felony


                                   51


 1   punishable as a felony under the Controlled" --

 2             MR. KNEEDLER:      Right.        And --

 3             JUSTICE BREYER:       -- "Substances Act."

 4             MR. KNEEDLER:      And --

 5             JUSTICE BREYER:       And there --

 6             MR. KNEEDLER:      -- a number --

 7             JUSTICE BREYER:       Yeah.       You have to know the

 8   answer to that.

 9             MR. KNEEDLER:      -- a number of Courts of Appeals

   that have looked at this in the sentencing context over

   the years have concluded that it -- that the absence of

   that language is very significant, and the presence of the

   language that says "any felony" is also significant.

             JUSTICE SCALIA:       Never mind sentencing, let's

   get back to the immigration.           If I understand what you're

   now saying, if you're convicted in State Court of action

   that is a Federal felony, but it's just a State

   misdemeanor -- right? -- you look to the State of

   conviction, and it would be a misdemeanor, and the

   immigration provisions would not -- would not take effect.

   Is --

             MR. KNEEDLER:      Yes.

             JUSTICE SCALIA:       -- that right?

             MR. KNEEDLER:      And that -- and that -- that's

   not true --


                                   52



 1             JUSTICE SCALIA:         That's extraordinary.

 2             MR. KNEEDLER:        No, but it's -- that's not --

 3   only true under this provision of 1101(a)(4).              The other

 4   -- the other provisions -- (f) and (g) and (j) and (q) and

 5   (t) that I mentioned, that looked to the sentence that may

 6   be imposed under State law, or that was actually imposed

 7   -- would, likewise, render someone in that situation who

 8   was convicted of only a misdemeanor in State Court -- even

 9   though it might be a felony under Federal law, they would

   not be -- they would not be convicted of an aggravated

   felony, because --

             JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Mr. Kneedler --

             MR. KNEEDLER:        -- of the way Congress chose to

   write 1101(a)(43).

             JUSTICE STEVENS:            But is --

             JUSTICE GINSBURG:              Do you --

             JUSTICE STEVENS:            -- that a reasonable -- let's

   say the statute's ambiguous, and you've convinced us

   there's no constitutional requirement of uniformity.             But

   is it reasonable to assume that Congress would want the

   different consequences to depend on the State of

   conviction?

             MR. KNEEDLER:        I think it is.        I mean, they're

   --

             JUSTICE STEVENS:            Is there anything in the


                                     53



 1   legislative history suggesting that?

 2              MR. KNEEDLER:      I think -- as I say, I think it's

 3   on face of the statute.

 4              JUSTICE GINSBURG:            Barrett suggests otherwise.

 5   If what Congress was trying to do was to codify that

 6   practice of looking for an analogous crime under State

 7   law, that's -- that seems to me the -- at least what

 8   Congress was trying do.

 9              MR. KNEEDLER:      Well, that -- the legislative

   history of the amendment in 1990 does not discuss the

   aspect of Barrett that went to the comparison to decide

   what -- in what circumstances there would be an analogous

   Federal crime.   It was clear that it wanted to ratify the

   result that State crimes are covered.

              But we think that that was evident from the 1988

   amendments to -- that both enacted the definition of

   "aggravated felony," revised the definition of "drug-

   trafficking crime" to delete the requirement that it be a

   Federal felony -- that was deleted in 1988 -- and enhanced

   sentences --

              JUSTICE GINSBURG:            You --

              MR. KNEEDLER:      -- under 1326, clearly on the --

   on -- by reference to whether someone was convicted of a

   State felony, without any -- without any general Federal

   minimum.


                                    54


 1             JUSTICE GINSBURG:               May I --

 2             MR. KNEEDLER:         What Congress --

 3             JUSTICE GINSBURG:               May I just switch gears for a

 4   moment, because your time is almost up, and we -- you

 5   haven't addressed the mootness problem in Toledo-Flores.

 6             MR. KNEEDLER:         In Toledo-Flores.

 7             JUSTICE GINSBURG:               Is the Second Circuit wrong

 8   in U.S. v. Hamdi?     Because it seems to me that U.S. v.

 9   Hamdi is on all fours with respect to mootness.

             MR. KNEEDLER:         Yes.       We think it is wrong, be --

   under this Court's decision in Spencer versus Kemna and

   other cases, that, if the possible consequence turns on a

   discretionary judgment that may be made by someone else,

   that is too speculative to constitute a real live case or

   controversy.    And that's what I understand Toledo-Flores

   to be arguing, is that if he applied for discretionary

   relief in the future, that it might -- it might matter,

   because his sentence might be reduced slightly.

             I should point out that in the District Court

   Toledo-Flores conceded that if he didn't get an eight-

   level sentence enhancement, he would get a four-level

   sentence enhancement, because this is at least a felony,

   within the meaning of the adjacent provision of the

   guidelines.     That would result in a guideline range of 24

   to 30 months.     He would then have gotten 24 months, under


                                      55


 1   that guideline range, the very same thing that he got

 2   here.   And, under the guidelines at the time, a term of

 3   supervised release was mandatory.           And a 1-year term of

 4   supervised release was mandatory in those circumstances.

 5   He would have gotten exactly the same term of supervised

 6   release if he had been -- if he had gotten only the four-

 7   level enhancement, rather than the eight-level

 8   enhancement.

 9              I also think that it is somewhat farfetched to

   think that, given the fact that Toledo-Flores had more

   than 12 illegal entries into the United States, and

   various State offenses, that the determination of whether

   the attorney general would actually grant discretionary

   relief would turn on a marginal difference in the sentence

   on that particular offense.

              CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:           Thank you, Mr. Kneedler.

              Mr. Long, you have 4 minutes remaining.

            REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. LONG, JR.

                  ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER LOPEZ

              MR. LONG:    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

              In answer to Justice Breyer's question, Mr.

   Kneedler said that a Federal misdemeanor is a drug-

   trafficking crime under Section 924(c) if a State punishes

   it as a felony.   He said, "Well, the Federal Government

   never prosecutes Federal misdemeanors under Section


                                    56


 1   924(c)."   He said, "The reason is because of

 2   924(c)(1)(A)," and the language there is, it has to be an

 3   offense for which the person may be prosecuted in a court

 4   of the United States.      But that language -- a person may

 5   be prosecuted in a court of the United States for a

 6   misdemeanor.     So, the Government is making an argument

 7   that, to my knowledge, has never been accepted by any

 8   court, has not ever been advanced by the Government in a

 9   criminal context, and that would significantly expand

   Section 924(c) and numerous other criminal statutes that

   we cite in our brief that used the same definition of

   "drug-trafficking crime."

              The -- Mr. Kneedler also said that the

   aggravated felony provisions in Section 101(a)(43) refer

   to State law, but I read them just the opposite.              There

   are two kinds.    There are 21 of them.            Many of them say,

   "an offense described in 18 U.S. Code Section X."              I mean,

   that's really what -- we're dealing with one of those

   here.   So, it clearly goes to Federal law to define the

   offense.   Now, if State law or foreign law also punishes

   that offense, then it's an aggravated felony, but,

   clearly, Federal law is defining the offense.

              There are other categories, such as murder and

   theft, that are defined, in general terms; but the

   Government's position, as I understand it, is, again, you


                                      57



 1   use a generic uniform definition.            You don't pick any

 2   definition that the States may have.              The Court just

 3   granted --

 4                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:          Well, I thought -- I

 5   thought you conceded that a State offense could constitute

 6   illicit trafficking --

 7                MR. LONG:   Well, yes --

 8                CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:          -- in a Controlled

 9   Substance --

                MR. LONG:   Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.          But, again,

   to be clear -- and I think this is consistent with the

   Government's position in other cases -- ultimately, there

   will be some uniform Federal definition of what

   constitutes illicit trafficking.            It would be -- some

   commercial element would probably be the definition the

   Court hasn't decided.     States can define it more broadly.

   But the actual definition -- just as the definition of

   "burglary" or "theft" --

                JUSTICE ALITO:      You think there's a uniform

   Federal definition of a theft offense?

                MR. LONG:   Well, it's -- I mean, as -- this --

   in the Taylor case, in burglary, the Court has a

   methodology for this.     You pick a sort of generic

   definition.    It may not -- it may not come from a Federal

   statute; it could --


                                     58



 1             JUSTICE ALITO:       There's -- they'll -- there's no

 2   variation in State offenses that would fall within that, a

 3   theft offense?

 4             MR. LONG:    Well, it's -- again, this is -- the

 5   provision we're dealing with is -- looks to Federal law,

 6   the Controlled Substances Act and two other statutes.               My

 7   understanding of the Government's position -- and it's

 8   consistent with this Court's cases, in Taylor -- is that,

 9   even when it's a generic offense, you would -- you would

   still have a uniform definition.          And that is certainly

   consistent with the principle of uniformity that applies

   both in criminal law and in immigration law.             I mean, if

   there's any ambiguity, at the end of the day, ambiguities

   are supposed to be resolved in favor of uniformity,

   uniform Federal law -- uniform Federal criminal law, and

   uniform immigration law.     Effectively, what the Government

   is arguing that -- is that States can banish noncitizens,

   and can do so by enacting drug laws, deciding to make a

   simple possession offense a felony.             That's a decision

   that a State would make, almost certainly, for reasons

   that have little or nothing to do with immigration, and

   it's highly unlikely that Congress would have left that

   determination to States.

             On uniformity, aggravated felonies is a

   condition for citizenship.      If you're convicted of an


                                   59


 1   aggravated felony, you may not become a U.S. citizen.             You

 2   are foreclosed from establishing good moral character.

 3   So, in fact, citizenship is at stake here, and the

 4   Uniformity Clause is in play.

 5             If there are no further questions, thank you.

 6             CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:           Thank you, Mr. Long.
