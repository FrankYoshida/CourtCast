## 2015-01-08 compiled a similar statistic for interruptions to see which side, not which individual, was interrupted most.

## 2015-01-07 compiled word counts for each side. Turns out that if you know who is petitioner, who has more lawyers, 
## and who was interrupted, then knowing who got more words in doesn't tell you anything significant. 
## Possibly because it doesn't matter and possible b/c sample sizes are quite low at that point.

## 2015-01-05 changed pattern matching for finding names of lawyers to allow for whitespace after '.' before '\n'

    ######### Something may be wrong here. In 2012-2013 the P(win|Pet,R,R) = 0.75
    ######### In 2005-2013 it is 0.38. Granted 2012-2013 sample size is only 4, but still the direction seems wrong. More likely to win if interrupted more?
    ### Marginal P(win | pet, tie)? (ptp + ptr) / (ptp + ptr + rtp + rtr)
