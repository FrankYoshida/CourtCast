CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:     We'll hear argument

first this morning in Case 12-398, Association for

Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc.

Mr. Hansen?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER A. HANSEN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. HANSEN:     Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

One way to address the question presented by

this case is what exactly did Myriad invent?     And the

answer is nothing.

Myriad unlocked the secrets of two human

genes.     These are genes that correlate with an increased

risk of breast or ovarian cancer.     But the genes

themselves, their -- where they start and stop, what

they do, what they are made of, and what happens when

they go wrong are all decisions that were made by

nature, not by Myriad.

Now, Myriad deserves credit for having

unlocked these secrets.     Myriad does not deserve a

patent for it.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:     Mr. Hansen, Respondents

say that isolating or extracting natural products, that

has long been considered patentable, and give -­

examples were aspirin and whooping cough vaccine.     How

is this different from -- those start with natural -­

natural products.

MR. HANSEN:     Well, in -- in essence, Your

Honor, everything starts with a natural product.     And

this Court has said repeatedly that just extracting a

natural product is insufficient.     For example, this

Court has used the example of gold.     You can't patent

gold because it's a natural product.

The examples that you cite all involve

further manipulation of a product of nature, so that the

product of nature is no longer what it was in nature;

it's become something different.     And in many instances

has taken on a new function.

But -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:     Do you dispute that

you can patent, however, a process for extracting

naturally-occurring things?

MR. HANSEN:     Of course.     I think that is

totally acceptable.     And what's interesting in this case

is, the process that Myriad uses to extract the genes is

not at issue in this case.     It's a process that's used

by geneticists every day all over this country.     It is

routine, conventional science.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:     So isn't that -- why

isn't that a way to, in effect, have patent protection

for the product?     Does somebody who wants to use the

product, the DNA -- extracted DNA in this case, have to

find a new process from -- to extract it if they want to

have it available?

MR. HANSEN:     Well, the -- the process by

which it's extracted is now very routine.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:     Oh, no -- yes, I

know.     I'm assuming it isn't, that they discover this

process and it leads to a -- a particular product.     Does

anybody who wants to use the product either have to get

a license for the process or find a different way of

extracting it?

MR. HANSEN:     I think they have to find a

different way of extracting it, in the same way that

finding a method of extracting gold does entitle you to

a patent on the method of extracting gold, it may also

entitle you to a patent on the use of gold.     For

example, if you find a new way of using gold to make

earrings, or if you find a new way of using DNA to do

something, you may be entitled to a patent on that

because -­

extraction wasn't, and why.     Why would the tests -­

would the tests be subject to a patent?

MR. HANSEN:     The tests are also routine and

conventional science, but in this particular case, there

were some method claims that we challenged.     The method

claims in this case involved taking the genes that you

extracted from the woman and the gene that you -- the

way you think it should be, and simply looking back and

forth to see if they're the same or different.     And the

Federal Circuit that -- found that that was an abstract

idea and not patentable.

And, in fact, that's -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:     Well, I'm curious as to why

the methodology of extracting the gene has not been

patented.     You say everybody -- everybody uses it.     Why

wasn't that patented?

MR. HANSEN:     The original -- the original

methodology was patented, and is -- is patentable.     In

fact, if they came up with a new process, it would be

patentable.     But it has -- but that -- it has been very

freely licensed.     In fact, the patent may now have

expired.     And so it's used all over the country every

day.

Justice Ginsburg's question because I'm -- I don't -­

I'm not sure you got at what troubles me about that.

Suppose there is a substance, a -- a

chemical, a molecule in the -- the leaf -- the leaves of

a plant that grows in the Amazon, and it's discovered

that this has tremendous medicinal purposes.     Let's say

it -- it treats breast cancer.

A new discovery, a new way -- a way is

found, previously unknown, to extract that.     You make a

drug out of that.     Your answer is that cannot be

patent -- patented, it's not eligible for patenting

because the chemical composition of the -- of the drug

is the same as the chemical that exists in the leaves of

the plant.

MR. HANSEN:     If there is no alteration, if

we simply pick the leaf off of the tree and swallow it

and it has some additional value, then I think it is not

patentable.     You might be able to get a method patent on

it, you might be able to get a use patent on it, but you

can't get a composition patent.

But as -­

JUSTICE ALITO:     But you're making -- you

keep making the hypotheticals easier than they're

intended to be.     It's not just the case of taking the

leaf off the tree and chewing it.     Let's say if you do

that, you'd have to eat a whole forest to get the -- the

value of this.     But it's extracted and -- and reduced to

a concentrated form.     That's not patent -- that's not

eligible?

MR. HANSEN:     No, that may well be eligible

because you have now taken what was in nature and you've

transformed it in two ways.     First of all, you've made

it substantially more concentrated than it was in

nature; and second, you've given it a function.     If it

doesn't work in the diluted form but does work in a

concentrated form, you've given it a new function.     And

the -- by both changing its nature and by giving it a

new function, you may well have patent -­

JUSTICE ALITO:     Well, when you concede that,

then I'm not sure how you distinguish the isolated DNA

here because it has a different function.     Will you

dispute that?     Isolated DNA has a very different

function from the DNA as it exists in nature.     And

although the chemical composition may not be different,

it -- it certainly is in a different form.     So what is

the distinction?

MR. HANSEN:     Well, I don't think it has a

new function, Your Honor, with respect.     I believe that

what -- Myriad has proffered essentially three functions

for the DNA outside the body as opposed to inside the

body.     The first is we can look at it.     And that's true,

but that's not really a new function.     That's simply the

nature of when you extract something you can look at it

better.

The second two rationales that Myriad has

proffered are that it can be used as probes and primers.

Three of the -- three of lower court judges found that

full-length DNA, which all of these patent claims

include, cannot be used as probes and primers.     But more

important, finding a new use for a product of nature, if

you don't change the product of nature, is not

patentable.     If I find a new way of taking gold and

making earrings out of it, that doesn't entitle me to a

patent on gold.     If I find a new way of using lead, it

doesn't entitle me to a new -- to a patent on lead.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:     From what you know and

from what the record shows, would the process of tagging

the isolated DNA be patentable?     The process of tagging,

we just don't know about that or is there a patent on

that?

MR. HANSEN:     The very patents in this case

include claims on -- on DNA that is tagged so that it

can be used as a probe.     We have not challenged that.

We are not asking the Court to strike down that.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:     Under our -- our law, is a

patent ever divisible so that if it's valid in part but

invalid in another part, it can still stand as to the

part?

MR. HANSEN:     No, it is not permissible under

patent law to do essentially a narrowing -- narrowing

construction of the -- of the claim.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:     But if you haven't

challenged this, then -- then where are we with respect

to the tagging?     I don't quite understand.     Because

the -- the entire patent, which includes tagging, would

fail under your argument.

MR. HANSEN:     Oh, I'm sorry, no.     I

misunderstood.     The claims that we are challenging do

not -- are not limited to tagging, are not limited to

use as probes.     There are other claims that we are not

challenging that are limited to probes.     Those would

remain, but the -- but the claims that we're challenging

would in fact be struck down because they're not so

limited.     In fact -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:     Then -- then explain

when you said you can't narrow.     You said earlier you

can't narrow.

MR. HANSEN:     Yes.     If a claim reaches

something that is both impermissible and permissible,

it -- the claim is invalid, period.

MR. HANSEN:     That individual claim.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:     But the patent with

respect to claims that are not invalid would still

stand.

MR. HANSEN:     That is correct, Your Honor.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:     The primers and probes

stand.

MR. HANSEN:     Would -- would still remain.

Even if you were to rule for Petitioners, you would not

have to rule concerning the use of DNA as a probe or a

primer.

JUSTICE KAGAN:     Mr. Hansen, could you tell

me what you think the incentives are for a company to do

what Myriad did?     If you assume that it takes a lot of

work and takes a lot of investment to identify this

gene, but the gene is not changed in composition, and

what you just said is that discovering uses for that

gene would not be patentable, even if those new -- even

if those uses are new, what does Myriad get out of this

deal?     Why shouldn't we worry that Myriad or companies

like it will just say, well, you know, we're not going

to do this work anymore?

MR. HANSEN:     Well, we know that would not

have happened in this particular case, Your Honor.     We

know that there were other labs looking for the BRCA

genes and they had announced that they would not patent

them if they were the first to find it.     We also know

that prior to the patent actually being issued, there

were other labs doing BRCA testing and Myriad shut all

that testing down.     So we know in this particular case

that problem would not have arisen.

But the point of the whole -- the whole

point of the product of nature doctrine is that when you

lock up a product of nature, it prevents industry from

innovating and -- and making new discoveries.     It -­

that's the reason we have the product of nature

doctrine, is because there may be a million things you

can do with the BRCA gene, but nobody but Myriad is

allowed to look at it and that is impeding science

rather than advancing science.

answered her question.     Why?     Why would a company incur

massive investment if it -- if it cannot patent?

JUSTICE KAGAN:     I thought you were going to

say something else, Mr. Hansen, and I guess I -- I hoped

you were going to say something else, which is that,

notwithstanding that you can't get a patent on this

gene, that -- that there are still, you know, various

things that you could get a patent on that would make

this kind of investment worthwhile, in the usual case.

But if that's the case, I want to know what those things

are rather than you're just saying, you know, we're

supposed to leave it to scientists who want Nobel

Prizes.

And I agree that there are those scientists,

but there are also, you know, companies that do

investments in these kinds of things that you hope won't

just shut them down.

MR. HANSEN:     Let me give a specific example

that may be helpful in doing a better job of answering

the question.     One of the -- one of the amici has

worried a lot about whether a decision for the

Petitioners in this case would invalidate recombinant

DNA.     Recombinant DNA is in fact what all the major

innovations in the industry are doing these days.     It's

DNA where the scientist decides the sequence rather than

nature deciding the sequence.

There is nothing in our position that would

prevent recombinant DNA from being patented, but there

is -- it is the cases that if the patents are upheld,

recombinant DNA is frustrated.

People can't use pieces of the BRCA gene to

recombine them and find new treatments and find new

diagnoses and find new things that will advance medicine

and science as a result of these patents.     It's a

perfect example of what the point of the product of

nature doctrine is.

JUSTICE SCALIA:     Yes.     But, of course, to

profit from -- from that recombinant DNA, you have to

not just isolate the gene, but then you have to do

something with it afterwards.     So you really haven't

given us a reason why somebody would try to isolate the

gene.

MR. HANSEN:     Well -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:     I mean, sure, yes, I can do

stuff with it afterwards, but so can everybody else.

What advantage do I get from being the person that or

the company that isolated that -- that gene.     You say

none at all.

MR. HANSEN:     No, I think you get enormous

recognition, but I don't think -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:     Well, that's lovely.

MR. HANSEN:     But I think that we know that

that's sufficient.     We know it's sufficient with respect

to these two genes.     We also know it's sufficient with

respect to the human genome project.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:     Well, I'm not sure the

Court can decide the case on -- on that basis.     I'm sure

that there are substantial arguments in the amicus brief

that this investment is necessary and that -- and that

makes sense.     To say, oh, well, the taxpayers will do

it, don't worry, is, I think, an insufficient answer.

As Justice Kagan's follow-up questions

indicated, I thought you might say, well, there are

process patents that they can have, that this is

sufficient.

MR. HANSEN:     And that's certainly true.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:     But I -- I just don't

think we can decide the case on the ground, oh, don't

worry about investment, it'll come.     I -- I just don't

think we can do that.     It may be that the law allows you

to prevail on the fact that this is -- occurs in nature

and there's nothing new here, but that's quite

different.

MR. HANSEN:     And it is certainly true, as

Your Honor suggests, that one of the incentives here is

a process patent or a development patent.     If you -- if

you've isolated the gene and you find a new use for it,

you could get a patent on the new use for the patent.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:     That's the whole point,

isn't it?     The isolation itself is not valuable, it's

the use you put the isolation to.     That's the answer,

isn't it?

MR. HANSEN:     That's exactly correct.     Thank

you.     Yes, that is the answer.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:     And so that is the

answer, which is in isolation it has no value.     It's

just nature sitting there.

MR. HANSEN:     Interestingly, it has one

value.     And that is you can look at it to see if there's

a mutation in it.     And when you find a mutation in the

isolated gene, you write back to the woman who provided

the sample and you say to her because the isolated gene

is the same as the gene in your body, I can tell you

that there's a mutation in your body.

patent law.     It doesn't patent ideas.

MR. HANSEN:     And it shouldn't patent ideas,

and -- but it also makes the point that isolated gene

and the gene in the body are the same.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:     Can we go to -- can we

go to cDNA a moment?

MR. HANSEN:     Sure.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:     That is artificially

created in the laboratory, so it's not bound in nature.

It's not taking a gene and snipping something that's in

nature.     And yet you claim that can't be patented.     The

introns are taken out, the exons are left in, and

they're sequenced together.     Give me your brief argument

on that.     I read your brief, but it is not a product of

nature, it's a product of human invention.

MR. HANSEN:     There are two big differences

between cDNA and DNA.     The first is exactly the one Your

Honor just discussed, which is that the introns, the

noncoding regions, have been removed.     That is done in

the body, by the body.     That's done in the process of

DNA going to mRNA.

What the scientist does who's creating the

cDNA is they take the mRNA out of the body and then they

simply have the natural nature-driven nucleotide binding

processes complement the mRNA.     So that if the mRNA has

nucleotide in there and nature causes them to bind up.

The scientist does not decide -­

JUSTICE BREYER:     I know, but I don't see the

answer because I gather, if I -- if I've read it

correctly, that when you have an R -- the messenger RNA

does not have the same base pairs.     There's a U or

something instead of an A or whatever it is.

MR. HANSEN:     Yes.

JUSTICE BREYER:     So when you actually look,

if you could get a super-microscope and look at what

they have with the cDNA, with their cDNA, you would

discover something with an A, not a U.     Is it AU?     Is

that the one?

MR. HANSEN:     Yes.

JUSTICE BREYER:     Okay.     Okay.     So -- so you

would discover something with an A there, you see, and

you wouldn't discover something with a U there.     And

there is no such thing in nature as the no-introns AGG,

whatever, okay?     It's not there.     That's not truly

isolated DNA.     But you can go look up the Amazon,

wherever you want.     Hence the question.     Now, on that

one, how?     How is that found in nature?     The answer is

it isn't.

Honor, that the question is not whether it is identical

to something in nature.     The question is whether there

was a human invention involved, whether it is markedly

different from what is found in nature.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:     But that goes to

obviousness.     That does not in my mind go to the issue

of whether it's patent eligible.     You may have a very

strong argument on obviousness, but why does it not -­

it's creating something that's not found in nature at

all.

MR. HANSEN:     The sequence of the nucleotides

is dictated by nature.     The order that they go in is

dictated by nature.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:     Well, that's a separate

question -­

MR. HANSEN:     It is true -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- about whether this

claim is too expansive because it's claiming every 15

nucleotides and nature produces 15 randomly.     But

assuming the claim was for the entire mutated gene and

not the small snippet that they want to capture the

whole gene with, that's -- that whole gene without the

introns is just not found in nature.

when the body removes the introns, has the body made

something markedly different than what is in nature, and

it is our view -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:     When I first looked at

this case, I -- I thought that maybe the cDNA was kind

of an economy class gene, was -- it wasn't.     But my

understanding is that it may have a functionality that

the -- the DNA isolate does not, easier to tag, et

cetera.     That may be incorrect for the record, but that

was my present understanding.

MR. HANSEN:     It is somewhat easier to work

with cDNA to make recombinant DNA, and it's recombinant

DNA that is the place where all of the innovation and

all the efforts are taking place.     And if we lock -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:     Is all the tagging done on

recombinant DNA?

MR. HANSEN:     All of the change -- all of the

useful things that we are inventing is done -- is done

through the process of recombinant DNA.     And if we lock

up the cDNA, it makes it harder to do the recombinant

DNA.     So that if someone owns all the cDNA, I can't do

recombinant DNA using what the company owns.

others, the examples that I gave, you said they involve

manipulation.     The -- the cDNA can't be characterized as

involving manipulation?

MR. HANSEN:     It certainly -- there's -­

there is some manipulation, although it's -- it's

letting nature manipulate, not doing -- not the

scientist manipulating.     But it -- what the other factor

that distinguishes aspirin and the other examples you

use from cDNA is that they have -- the alteration of the

substance has also altered the function, and cDNA has

exactly the same function as DNA with the exception of

Justice Kennedy's, that it's easier to use with.

JUSTICE SCALIA:     Do you -- you've really

lost me when you say that it's nature that does the

alteration rather than the scientist.     I mean, whenever

a scientist does an alteration, he does it, you know, by

some force of nature.

in Funk Brothers didn't sit together in nature.

The scientists took them and put them

together in nature.     Here the scientist takes the exons

and lets the natural processes of the body put them

together in -- in the laboratory.     It's exactly the same

as Funk Brothers.

If I could reserve the remainder of my time,

Your Honor.

JUSTICE BREYER:     Can I ask a question, which

I don't think will be taken from your time.

MR. HANSEN:     Sure, of course.

JUSTICE BREYER:     But I have to ask you this.

Look, you say don't reach the cDNA issue and the reason

is because of the nature of the claim.     Okay, I look at

their claim.     Their claim says they want, "the isolated

DNA of claim 1 wherein said DNA has the nucleotide

sequence set forth in SEQ ID No. 1."

Then we turn to that and the first thing it

says right there is it says, "The molecule involved

is" -- "Molecule type:     cDNA."     And then it has a long

list and that long list is a list of the basis, okay.

So molecule type, cDNA.     So they say what do

you mean they aren't claiming cDNA?     That's what they

say they're claiming.

and the "wherein" -- you read "wherein" as in context,

and in this context you mean to say that a person who

makes isolated DNA that has lots of introns in it as

well as the sequence is going to be an infringer under

claim 2?

MR. HANSEN:     Yes, Your Honor.

is the definition of the DNA in the patent itself, which

we cite, which says that whenever we use the term "DNA"

we mean both.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.,

FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

SUPPORTING NEITHER PARTY

GENERAL VERRILLI:     Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

Enforcing the distinction between human

invention and a product of nature preserves a necessary

balance in the patent system between encouraging

individual inventors and keeping the basic building

blocks of innovation free for all to use.     Isolated DNA

falls on the ineligible side of that divide because it

is simply native DNA extracted from the body.     The claim

nothing?     Are you fighting over nothing?     If -- if they

can patent this cDNA in the way they have, what does it

matter, since it appears as if research has to rely on

the cDNA to be effective?

GENERAL VERRILLI:     I actually think that --

I think we're -- we're fighting about something of

importance.     That question gets right to it.     I want to

answer the question directly, Your Honor.     I'd like to

make a prefatory point before doing so.

The claim that isolated DNA is a human

invention rests entirely on the fact that it is no

longer connected at the molecular level to what

surrounded it in the body.     But allowing a patent on

that basis would effectively preempt anyone else from

using the gene itself for any medical or scientific

purpose.     That is not true about a patent on cDNA.     A

patent on cDNA leaves the isolated DNA available for

other scientists and other -- and others in the medical

just said that to do recombinant technology, you have to

use the cDNA rather than the native D -- the isolated

DNA.     Do you disagree with that?

GENERAL VERRILLI:     That's not my

understanding, Justice Kagan.     My understanding is that

you -- that the native DNA can be used for recombinant

DNA without the step of cDNA.     We do think cDNA is

important and the position of the United States is that

cDNA is patent eligible.     We disagree -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:     Well, suppose his

understanding is correct.     Suppose your

misunderstanding -- suppose your understanding is not

correct.

GENERAL VERRILLI:     Our position, though, is

that cDNA is patent eligible because we think, unlike

the isolated DNA which is just taken from your body,

cDNA is an artificial creation in the laboratory that

doesn't correspond to anything in your body.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:     But Mister -- General

Verrilli, I got the distinct impression from your brief

that your view was that, although the cDNA may be

patentable, it might very well be rejected as obvious.

GENERAL VERRILLI:     That's true now, Justice

Ginsburg, but obviousness is determined at the time that

the patent is issued, so what may be true now might not

have been true at the time the patents were initially

issued.     And -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:     I understand -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:     But I -- I thought

the basic general approach here was we have a very

expansive view of what is patent eligible and then we

narrow things through things -- issues like obviousness

and so on.     Why -- wouldn't it make more sense to

address the questions at issue here in the obviousness

realm?

GENERAL VERRILLI:     That's a little -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:     If you got something

that's big, it seems to me pretty obvious that you could

take a smaller part of it.     That the idea -- a smaller

part of something that's bigger is obvious.     Now, yes,

you can have a patent on the process of extracting that

small part, but I don't understand how a small part of

something bigger isn't obvious.     And if it is, I don't

understand why this -- these issues aren't addressed at

that stage.

GENERAL VERRILLI:     Well, I think my answer

to that, I guess, Your Honor, would -- would point first

to Mayo, in which the Court recognized that the

threshold test under Section 101 for patent eligibility

does do work that the obviousness test and a novelty

test and a specification test do not do, and the work

that it does here, I would respectfully submit, is to

ensure that the natural substance, the product of nature

itself, is not subjected effectively to a monopoly

because if it can be deemed to be a human invention

solely as a result of the change that occurs when you

extract it from the body, then that means, as a -- as a

practical matter that you have granted a patent on the

gene itself because no one else can extract it because

extracting it is isolating it, isolating it violates the

patent.

And so as a result of that, no one else can

try to develop competing tests for breast cancer, no one

else can try to use this gene for recombinant DNA.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:     I'm -- I'm not sure

that's responsive to my concern.     Your answer said well,

here are a lot of reasons why this shouldn't have patent

protection.     My question goes to whether we ought to

focus on those reasons at the eligibility stage or at

the obviousness stage.

GENERAL VERRILLI:     Well, the Court

identified in Chakrabarty and then reiterated in Mayo

that -- that it is -- that the right answer to that

question, Your Honor, is to focus on them at the

eligibility stage because the -- because getting the

balance right is of critical importance.

JUSTICE ALITO:     Well, the issue here is a

very difficult one.     It's one on which the government

has changed its position, isn't that correct?

GENERAL VERRILLI:     Yes, Your Honor.

JUSTICE ALITO:     It seems that there is

disagreement within the Executive Branch about it.     This

case has been structured in an effort to get us to

decide this on the broadest possible ground, that

there's no argument, that it's just about 101, it's not

about any other provision of the Patent Act.

Why -- why should we -- why should we do

that?     We have claims that if patent eligibility is

denied here it will prevent investments that are

necessary for the development of new drugs or it will

lead those who develop the new drugs to -- new

diagnostic techniques, to keep those secret, not

disclose them to the public.     Why -- why should we jump

in and -- and decide the broadest possible question?

GENERAL VERRILLI:     Well, I would -- again, I

would point the Court to what the Court said last term

in Mayo, which is that the determination of patent

eligibility really is a double-edged sword.

And it may be that in a -- in a particular

case, maybe this case, although we are not expressing a

view on it, you could sort the issue out on some of the

other criteria, but that won't generally be true, and

the proposition of whether you can patent the gene

itself is a question we think of fundamental importance,

and it raises exactly the two-edged sword concern that

led the Court to conclude what it did in Mayo.     And Mayo

was a situation very much -- I'm sorry.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:     General Verrilli, there's

an assertion made in Respondents' brief that the United

States would be in a singular position.     That is, they

suggest that in every other industrialized nation this

could be subject -- could be patentable.

GENERAL VERRILLI:     Yes, and that -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:     Is that so?

GENERAL VERRILLI:     No.     I think the picture

is much more complicated than that.     In many other

nations it wouldn't be patentable and the patent law is

different from nation to nation.

I'll give one example I think helps

illustrate the point.     In Germany and France, for

example, you can get a patent on isolated genomic DNA,

but only for a particular use.     So you would get what is

the equivalent of a use patent, which is a patent that

we would think under our patent laws is acceptable, too.

If you -- just as with the question that

Justice Alito asked earlier about identifying a -- a

useful substance in a plant in the Amazon, if you

isolate that and it proves to have therapeutic effects,

you can get a patent on that use of it, but what you

can't do is get a patent on the substance itself so that

no one else can explore it for different uses and for -­

and for different therapeutic purposes or to try to

recombine it and turn it into a -- an even more

therapeutic -- therapeutically valuable substance.     And

that's -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:     I understand why you are

saying cDNA is patentable as a subject matter.     I am

looking at the way the claim is phrased, however, and it

says that it's patenting a DNA segment 15 nucleotides

long or longer.     The reality is that 15 nucleotides

doesn't necessarily bridge a sequence that goes between

exons.     It -- it can -- one exon can be 15 or more

sequences long.     So are you arguing that this claim as

written is sustainable?

GENERAL VERRILLI:     Your Honor, as a -- I am

going to invoke my privilege as an amicus in this

situation.     I think that's a fight between the parties.

The point that we wanted to make is that as a conceptual

matter cDNA is patent eligible.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:     So you are not taking

the position that this claim as written is patentable?

GENERAL VERRILLI:     That's right, Your Honor.

We're just saying as a conceptual matter that we think

cDNA is a creation of the lab, it's an artificial

creation, it's as a general matter patent eligible.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:     Because as I understand

it, 15 nucleotides long exists naturally in nature.

They get reproduced in that sequence of 15.

GENERAL VERRILLI:     That -- that may well be

right, Your Honor.     As I said, we're not taking a

position on the particulars.

But if I -- just to return to the point that

Justice Alito made, the Court really was faced with a

similar situation in Mayo.     On the one side you had

the -- the industry coming in and saying, look, we have

got a lot of reliance issue, PTO has issued more than

150,000 patents here.     You are going to really disrupt

those reliance issues.     On the other side you had the

American Medical Association, as you have here, coming

in and saying, actually, these patents inhibit much more

innovation than they incent.

And what the Court said is that -- as

Justice Kennedy alluded to earlier, that the Court's not

in a position to resolve that dispute conclusively.     It

doesn't have the institutional wherewithal to do it.

But what the Court is in a position to do is to apply

the general principles of law as they were articulated

in Mayo, and then if there needs to be a particular

different set of rules for the biotech industry,

Congress can provide that different set of rules.

JUSTICE KAGAN:     General Verrilli, could

I understand what you said because I think it might be a

little bit different from Mr. Hansen and I just want to

understand your position.     You said that a company can't

get a -- a patent on the thing, but can get it on the

uses.     So if I find this plant, let's say, in the Amazon

and I can't get a patent on the thing itself, but can I

get a patent when I discover that if you eat this plant

it has therapeutic effects?

Mr. Chief Justice?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY A. CASTANIAS

MR. CASTANIAS:     Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

It is now 33 years after Chakrabarty,

31 years after the first isolated gene molecule patents

issued, and 12 years after the Patent and Trademark

Office issued its carefully reasoned Utility Guidelines

confirming that new isolated gene molecules are eligible

for patents.     And it's almost 16 years after Myriad's

patents began to issue, Patents which -- yes?

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:     Is that on the basis of

a new extraction process?

MR. CASTANIAS:     On a -- a new extraction

process, no.     Most of the processes are known.     But

that's not relevant to patent eligibility or, for that

matter, patentability.     As the last sentence, Justice

Sotomayor, of Section 103A says, "Patentability shall

not be negated by the manner in which the invention was

created."

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:     I -- I have a sort of

analytical problem.     I find it very, very difficult to

conceive how you can patent a sequential numbering

system by nature, in the same way that I have a problem

in thinking that someone could get a patent on the

computer binary code merely because they throw a certain

number of things on a piece of paper in a certain order.

I always thought that to have a patent you

had to take something and add to what nature does.     So

how do you add to nature when all you are doing is

copying its sequence?

MR. CASTANIAS:     Well, I guess I'll -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:     How do you add to it

besides process or use?

MR. CASTANIAS:     Sure.     Well, Justice

Sotomayor, I guess I'll take issue with the notion that

there is nothing additive here.     What Myriad inventors

created in this circumstance was a new molecule that had

never before been known to the world.     Now remember,

genes are themselves human constructs.     And this points

up some of the serious analytical problems with the

Product of Nature Doctrine as the line-drawing exercise

eggs, butter -- and I create my chocolate chip cookie.

And if I combust those in some new way, I can get a

patent on that.     But I can't imagine getting a patent

simply on the basic items of salt, flour and eggs,

simply because I've created a new use or a new product

absolutely true with regard to the isolated molecule as

those interminable chemical equations that we had to do

in high school, it's a "C" very different, "H" very

different.

genome itself has over 3 billion.     It's arranged in the

way set forth -- as set forth in the SEQ IDs number 1

and 2.     Number 2 is the so-called genomic DNA, SEQ ID

number 1 is the, as Justice Breyer understood, the cDNA

molecule.

When you look at those particular sequences,

there was invention in the decision of where to begin

the gene and where to end the gene.     That was not given

by nature.     In fact -­

this is something I was going to ask you.     I -- I assume

that it's true that -- that those abridged genes,

whatever you want to call them, do exist in the body.

That they do exist.     You -- you haven't created a type

MR. CASTANIAS:     But we've -- I'll -- I'll

use my own simplistic analogy which we offered in our

brief and which we offered to the lower court.     A

baseball bat doesn't exist until it's isolated from a

tree.     But that's still the product of human invention

to decide where to begin the bat and where to end the

JUSTICE BREYER:     Well, that's true, but then

you were saying something that I just didn't understand

because I thought the -- the scientists who had filed

briefs here, as I read it, said it's quite true that the

chromosome has the BRCA gene in the middle of it and

it's attached to two ends.

But also in the body, perhaps because cells

die, there is isolated DNA.     And that means that the DNA

strand, the chromosome strand is cut when a cell dies,

and then isolated bits get around, and there may be very

few of them in the world, but there are some, by the

laws of probability, that will in fact match precisely

the BRCA1 gene.

Now, have I misread what the scientists told

us, or are you saying that the scientists are wrong?

MR. CASTANIAS:     Well, I will tell you

that -­

JUSTICE BREYER:     I probably misread it.

There's a better chance that I've misread it.

MR. CASTANIAS:     Well, no, I think -- I think

you may have read some of the submissions correctly,

Justice Breyer.     I think that's a question -­

MR. CASTANIAS:     Well, what I will tell

neither of us are scientists, I would like you to tell

me what I should read that will, from a scientist, tell

me that it's wrong.

MR. CASTANIAS:     You want me to tell you

JUSTICE BREYER:     No, I need to know -­

brief is that these pseudogenes, which are un -­

MR. CASTANIAS:     -- mutations that are likely

to result in cancer.

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice?

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:     Can I get back to

your baseball bat example?

MR. CASTANIAS:     Sure.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:     My understanding -­

my understanding is that here, what's involved,

obviously through scientific processes, but we're not

talking about process.     Here, what's involved is

snipping.     You've got the thing there and you snip -­

snip off the top and you snip off the bottom and there

you've got it.

The baseball bat is quite different.     You

don't look at a tree and say, well, I've cut the branch

here and cut it here and all of a sudden I've got a

baseball bat.     You have to invent it, if you will.     You

don't have to invent the particular segment of the -- of

the strand, you just have to cut it off.

MR. CASTANIAS:     Well, I -- I guess I'll even

take issue with that because the -- the story of how the

SEQ ID number 2, the genomic DNA segment came about is

exactly the opposite of that.     If you look, for example,

at page 488 of the Joint Appendix, that's the

declaration of one of the inventors, Donna Shattuck, at

paragraph 27, what -- what she explains is that the

Myriad inventors first created the cDNA, which we agree

at least on that score with the Solicitor General, is

indeed eligible for patenting.     But then -- and by the

way, that cDNA was created from hundreds of different

patient samples to create what was called a consensus

sequence.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:     Okay.     You've got

the cDNA.

MR. CASTANIAS:     And then what the -- what

the Myriad inventors then did to create what is called

SEQ ID number 2 and what is claimed in claim 1 of the

'282 patent is to take -- actually manipulate that

further to add in the introns.     It was in -- actually,

the inventive process was additive.

Now, ultimately, again, going back to the

last sentence of section 103, the patentability should

not be negative -- or negated by the manner in which an

invention was made, maybe that shouldn't matter.     But it

just snipping along -- along the line.

MR. CASTANIAS:     Well, first of all, you

wouldn't even know where to snip until the Myriad

invention.     That's the first problem.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:     Okay.     So that's a

particular -- where you snip.     We're talking about

though the patentability of what's left -­

MR. CASTANIAS:     Right.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:     -- after you've

snipped it.

MR. CASTANIAS:     And -- and that is indeed a

product of human ingenuity and that has substantial new

uses.     Now, my friends on the other side have said -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:     Mr. Castanias, go back to

Justice Alito's plant in the Amazon, right because it

takes a lot of ingenuity and a lot of effort to actually

find that plant, just as it takes a lot of effort and a

lot of ingenuity to figure out where to snip on -- on

the genetic material.

But are you -- are you saying that you could

patent that plant because it takes a lot of effort and a

lot of ingenuity to find it?

MR. CASTANIAS:     The plant itself, I think

not, Justice Kagan, but I think the question that was -­

that was posed was whether I could take an extract from

that plant.

JUSTICE KAGAN:     I'm not -- I mean, I don't

the plant and uproot it, all right?

You've now taken it out of the Amazon forest.     Can you

MR. CASTANIAS:     Well, what I -- what I

haven't done is isolated a new thing.     All I have done

is isolate the plant from the forest.     And that's the

distinction I think I'm trying to get across to the

Court, not particularly well at least in my colloquy

with Justice Breyer, but I'll try again.     And that is

body here is fundamentally different in kind from what

was in -- what is in the body.     The most important

reason it's different in kind is that it cannot be used

in the body to detect the risk of breast and ovarian

cancers.

JUSTICE KAGAN:     Well, the plant in the

forest can't be used for any purpose either.     It only

has a use when it's taken out -- you know, when it's

uprooted and taken out of the forest.     But it's still

the same thing.     And I guess what you haven't gotten me

to understand is how this is different than that.     It's

still the same thing, but now that you've isolated it,

it in fact has lots of great uses.

MR. CASTANIAS:     Well, I think there are two

ways -- two ways to look at that.

First of all, if you want to look at it from

the -- the perspective of the so-called product of

nature doctrine, which I think has some very dangerous

consequences if it's not cabined and understood

correctly.     But if you look at it strictly from a

product of nature doctrine, you could say, well, that's

the same plant and it says in the 1930 legislative

history of the Plant Patent Act that plants that are

unmanipulated by the hand of man are not eligible for

patents, and that's fine, in terms of their breeding and

genetics and that sort of thing.

But the product of nature doctrine is

troublesome for this reason, modern medicine -- go

beyond just the isolated DNA patents here.     Modern

medicine, particularly the area of personalized

medicine, is trying to get to a point where what we are

administering to individual patients is giving them the

opportunity to mimic the actions of the body.     And -- so

actually, the goal of medicine is to get closer to

nature, rather than farther away.     And anything that

takes the product of nature doctrine beyond the simple

truism that the product of nature is something that is

not a human invention, then that's very dangerous, not

just for our case -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:     But when you -- when you

isolate the DNA, that by itself cannot be used as -- as

a probe until you add tags and -- and other chemicals

that make it a probe.

MR. CASTANIAS:     As a probe, that's true.     As

a primer, that wouldn't be required.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:     So it seemed to me your -­

your answer was not quite accurate when you said, well,

it can't be used in the body to detect breast cancer.

Neither can the isolate without some additions.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:     Now, if it's -- if it's

the process or the additions that make it patentable,

fine.     But you're say that the moment it's snipped, it's

patentable, and that it seems to me was -- was the point

of Justice Kagan's question.

MR. CASTANIAS:     Well, I -- I will say that

that is the final inventive act.     It's not the only

inventive act.     It's the final inventive act.     If -- if

indeed you were creating it -­

MR. CASTANIAS:     I'm sorry.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:     Do you concede at least

that the decision in the Federal Circuit, that Judge

Lourie did make an incorrect assumption, or is the

Lander brief inaccurate with respect to that, too?     That

is, Judge Lourie thought that isolated DNA fragments did

not exist in the human body and Dr. Lander says that

wrong.

MR. CASTANIAS:     No, what -- I think

Justice -- Judge Lourie was exactly correct to say that

there is nothing in this record that says that isolated

DNA fragments of BRCA1 exist in the body.     Neither does

Dr. Lander's brief, for that matter.     And for that

Dr. Lander's brief again are -- are what are known

pseudogenes.     They're typically things that have been

killed off or mutated by a virus, but they do not -­

JUSTICE ALITO:     But isn't this just a

question of probability?     To get back to your baseball

bat example, which at least I -- I can understand better

than perhaps some of this biochemistry, I suppose that

in, you know, I don't know how many millions of years

trees have been around, but in all of that time possibly

someplace a branch has fallen off a tree and it's fallen

into the ocean and it's been manipulated by the waves,

and then something's been washed up on the shore, and

what do you know, it's a baseball bat.

Is that -­

(Laughter.)

JUSTICE ALITO:     -- is that what Dr. Lander

is talking about?

MR. CASTANIAS:     That's pretty much the same

as what he's talking about, is that there might be

something that was out there somewhere.     But -- but

that's really -- the search for this sort of thing that

might be very similar to the thing but never was known

before.     The patent law has taught -- the patent law is

all about pushing the frontiers.

JUSTICE BREYER:     All right.     So when you are

on that, that's good.     A more basic question to me is

when you use the word "dangerous."     I had thought -- and

you can -- I'd be interested in your view -- that the

patent law is filled with uneasy compromises because on

the one hand, we do want people to invent.     On the other

hand, we're very worried about them tying up some kind

of whatever it is, particularly a thing that itself

could be used for further advance.

And so that the compromise that has been

built historically into this area is, of course, if you

get a new satisfying process to extract the sap from the

plant in the Amazon, patented.     Of course, if you get

the sap out and you find that you can use it, you

manipulate it, you use it, you figure out a way to use

it to treat cancer, wonderful, patented.     But what you

can't patent is the sap itself.

Now, in any individual case that might be

unfortunate or fortunate.     But consider it in the mine

run of things.     It's important to keep products of

nature free of the restrictions that patents there are,

so when Captain Ferno goes to the Amazon and discovers

50 new types of plants, saps and medicines, discovers

them, although that expedition was expensive, although

nobody had found it before, he can't get a patent on the

thing itself.     He gets a patent on the process, on the

use of the thing, but not the thing itself.

Now, that's my understanding of what I'd

call hornbook patent law, which you I confess probably

understand better than I.

MR. CASTANIAS:     Well -­

JUSTICE BREYER:     And I would like you to

express your view on that because that's the framework

that I am bringing to the case.

MR. CASTANIAS:     I -- I will offer the view,

Justice Breyer.

First of all, in this Court's decision in

Brenner v. Manson, followed repeatedly by the Federal

Circuit, it has been hornbook patent law, to use your

term, that you do not need to -- to call out the utility

of an invention in a particular claim.     What you do have

to do is have utility for the invention itself described

in the specification.

And that's what the Patent Office looked to

in its Utility Guidelines in 2001.     But ultimately,

neither -- I think this case is very -- very easily

decided on a straightforward ground that does not

require the Court to go making fine distinctions between

cDNA and DNA.

And that ground is this:     The reasoned

Utility Guidelines issued in 2001 by the Patent Office,

who has not, in a very significant decision, joined the

brief of the Solicitor General in this case -- and which

they continue to apply under Section 2107 of the Manual

of Patent Examining Procedure, this -- these guidelines

not only tell examiners what to do, but in the Federal

Register they had notice and comment and 23 specific

reasoned, supported by case law, supported by science,

responses to the objectors.     Almost every objection that

is made to our patents here was made there and answered

there.

The PTO issued those guidelines to the

public.     They have been relied on now for 12 years, and

they confirm a practice that has been in place much

longer than that.     And if you take -- whether you can

call it the Skidmore deference or just giving respect to

the agency that sits at the intersection of law and

science -- Justice Breyer, as your opinion for the Court

in Dickinson v. Zurko pointed out -- those -- that

decision by the Patent Office is entitled to respect,

reason for that is -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:     At least that the

strength of the presumption would be diluted.

MR. CASTANIAS:     I think you can dilute it a

little bit, but you can't take away the fact that it is

a 30-plus year practice that the Patent Office, despite

the executive's position in this Court and in the

Federal Circuit, continues to follow.

JUSTICE KAGAN:     Mr. Castanias, could I take

you away from the deference point and just ask again

about the -- the kind of law that you would have us

make.     Do you think that the first person who isolated

chromosomes could have gotten a patent on that?

MR. CASTANIAS:     I think in theory that is

possible, but I should say this because this case is

about Section 101, I'm trying -- I'm answering your

question as though it's about 101, patent eligibility.

JUSTICE KAGAN:     Yes.

MR. CASTANIAS:     Would it be obvious, would

it be novel?     I'm not sure.     Those are different -­

those are different analytical structures.

JUSTICE KAGAN:     Right.

MR. CASTANIAS:     But would it -- and I think

really, the -- the statute does the work here.     It is

new and useful composition of matter -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:     But the first -­

MR. CASTANIAS:     -- if it had use.     If it had

a new utility, then yes.

JUSTICE KAGAN:     I'm sorry, because -­

because -- because, like Justice Breyer, I consider

uses -- patents on uses in a different category.

So I'm just asking, could you patent the

isolated chromosome?

MR. CASTANIAS:     Again, I -- I perhaps am not

making myself as clear as I should.     In Section 101, a

patent claim must be shown to be useful.     And that -­

that is a utility that it has to be shown -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:     Yes.     Chromosomes are very

useful.

MR. CASTANIAS: -- in any case.

(Laughter.)

JUSTICE KAGAN:     The first person who found a

chromosome and isolated it, I think we can all say that

that was a very useful discovery.

And the question is, can you then -- can the

person who found that chromosome and isolated it from

the body, could they have gone to the PTO?

MR. CASTANIAS:     If they -- if -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:     And the PTO seems very

patent happy, so could, you know, would -- would they

MR. CASTANIAS:     I think if -- to get through

the Section 101 gateway, if that chromosome had a

specific substantial and credible utility, in other

words, it could be used in some -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:     Yes, of course it does.

MR. CASTANIAS:     -- diagnostic way in the way

that we're talking about here, then yes, it would pass

through the Section 101 gate.     Whether it would pass

through the Section 102 gate or the 103 gate, I don't

have any opinion on.

JUSTICE KAGAN:     Would -- would -- okay.

MR. CASTANIAS:     And then there's the

further -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:     And that's interesting -­

MR. CASTANIAS:     Sure.

JUSTICE KAGAN:     -- because then it's not a

question about, you know, breaking these covalent bonds

or whatever Judge Lourie thought it was about.     Right?

So you know, if -- if not DNA, if -- if not

the -- the more smaller unit in the chromosome, you

know, we could just go up from there and talk about all

kinds of parts of the human body, couldn't we?     Couldn't

we get to, you know, the first person who found a liver?

Justice Kagan, you're really putting your finger on the

problem with this, again, I -- I keep wanting to refer

to as the so-called Product of Nature Doctrine because I

don't believe that as a separate doctrine it really

exists.     It's just the flip side of the coin of

something that shows a lack of invention.

And, of course, that's where Section 103

comes into full force as the Chief Justice mentioned

earlier in the argument.     Section 103 allows you to make

comparisons to what was old and what was new.     I don't

think the organ, the liver, gets past 103 in that

circumstance even if you say, well -­

JUSTICE BREYER:     You are saying it gets past

101.

MR. CASTANIAS:     Even if it gets through the

101 -­

JUSTICE BREYER:     Well, that's -- that's the

problem.     I mean, all parts of the human body?     Anything

from inside the body that you snip out and isolate?

MR. CASTANIAS:     No.

JUSTICE BREYER:     And it gets through 101?

Does it have to -- I mean, that's actually what's

bothering me.

MR. CASTANIAS:     Okay.     So let -- let me try

to help you with that.     Because -- because the

distinction is between the liver or the kidney, which

was the one brought up in the federal circuit opinion,

but liver, kidney, you know, gallbladder, pick your

organ.     But it's the same thing.     It is the same thing

when it's inside the body and it's out.     That's where

our -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:     But you're not

suggesting if you cut off a piece of the liver or a

piece of the kidney that that somehow makes that piece

patentable.

MR. CASTANIAS:     No.     Absolutely not.     It's

the same thing.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:     So what's the

difference?     I mean, if you cut off a piece of the whole

in the kidney or liver, you're saying that's not

patentable, but you take a gene and snip off a piece,

that is?     What's the difference between the two -­

MR. CASTANIAS:     I would say that -- I would

say that under -- under your existing decisions in

Chakrabarty, J.E.M., that set forth a broad

understanding of Section 101 and an understanding of

what is within the limited exception, then what -- I --

I would -- I mean, honestly, I think that Section 103

does this work better than Section 101, but to the point

of Section 101, there's -- there is nothing different

about that piece in the body.

JUSTICE BREYER:     Ah.     Then -- then watch

what you're doing.     That's very, very interesting.

Because, really, we are reducing, then, 101 to anything

under the sun, and -- and that, it seems to me, we've

rejected more often than we've followed it.

And particularly with a thing found in

nature doctrine because, of course, it doesn't just -­

human kidneys and so forth.     Everything is inside

something else.     Plants, rocks, whatever you want.     And

so everything will involve your vast taking something

out of some other thing where it is, if only the

environment.     And it's at that point that I look for

some other test than just that it was found within some

other thing.

MR. CASTANIAS:     And I think, Justice Breyer,

there is where I've -- I've tried to explain to you

about the different functions, the different values.     If

you think about patents as economic instruments, the

different economic values that come out of this, the

different things that patients now have as a result of

this human ingenuity, they didn't have the BRCA1

isolated gene before the Myriad invention.

that with atomic energy, with electric, but so far the

choice -- electricity -- but so far the choice of the

patent was that we have a uniform rule for all

industries.

MR. CASTANIAS:     Right, but in -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:     And -- and that avoids

giving special industries special subsidies, which is

very important it seems to me.

Let me ask you this, and it's consistent

with my -- my preface.     If we were to accept the

government's position that the DNA is not patentable but

the cDNA is, would that give the industry sufficient

protection for innovation and research?     And if not, why

not?

MR. CASTANIAS:     The -- the problem of making

that decision now is that so much has happened since

these gene patents issued and since the Utility

Guidelines.     I can't tell you for a certainty whether it

will hurt the industry as a general matter to not have

isolated gene but only have cDNA patents.

But here's what I think it will hurt, and I

think it ultimately will hurt the doctrine that this

Court comes out of this case with.     Because what you

will then be asking litigants to do and courts to do is

to draw fine distinctions under Section 101 between,

well, how much more manipulation.

My friend on the other side used the term,

in response to Justice Ginsburg, "further manipulation

is required to take it out of the product of nature."

He -- he said no alteration, to Justice Alito, would

make it a product of nature.     But there's no dispute in

this case that there has been some alteration of the

isolated DNA molecules.

And that brings me back to the Utility

Guidelines.     This line was drawn.     It was drawn by an

expert agency that sits at the intersection of law and

science, and it has said, without any apparent -- other

than the declarations and amicus briefs that have been

put into this case -- without any apparent effect on the

explosion in biotechnology and the successful,

economically successful, technologically successful, and

life-saving industry that is at the heart of these

inventions.

That has not -- those -- that parade of

horribles has not happened.     And you don't have to

hypothesize at this point because you've got all of

these years of experience between the time these patents

issued and the time that this -- this challenge

belatedly came along.

opinion for the Court in Mayo made that very much an

important point, but I think what you -- what is

important to understand here is that these patent claims

aren't for methods.     They don't prevent -- present that

problem that the Court identified in that argument and

in the argument in Bilski.     These are for specific

molecules that exist in the physical world.     That -­

that concern that is present with method claims is not

here, these patents cover -- these patent claims cover

only what is claimed and no more.

There is no risk of a natural law or a

physical phenomenon like energy or electricity, neither

of which falls within the statutory categories.     There

is no risk of anything being preempted other than what

the claims properly claim, which are human-made

inventions of isolated molecules.

And I think one last point to close on.

It's important to note that molecules have been patented

for a very long time.     That's what drugs are.     And drugs

are often made by taking one molecule and another

molecule, both of which are known, reacting them in a

test tube, which is a very common thing, reactions have

been around 100 years just like snipping has been, but

they make something new and useful and life saving from

that.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:     Well, I don't

understand how this is at all like that because there

you're obviously combining things and getting something

new.     Here you're just snipping, and you don't have

anything new, you have something that is a part of

something that has existed previous to your

intervention.

MR. CASTANIAS:     Well, again,

Mr. Chief Justice, I -- I -- the discussion we had

earlier, the -- in -- in fact, the sequence that's

claimed in Claim 1 of the '282 patent was not created by

snipping.     If I can just conclude with one more

sentence?

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:     Sure.

MR. CASTANIAS:     Only once it was created can

a scientist ever know how and where to make the decision

to snip.

value in that in the sense that -- that, A, it

reinforces the Product of Nature Doctrine, but more

importantly, the effect of the patents in this case

allows Myriad to stop all research on a part of the

human body.     If you uphold the patents in this case,

Myriad can -- has the authority given it by the

government to stop anyone from doing research on a piece

of the human body.     That would be a significant advance,

if you were to -- to make it clear that was

impermissible.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:     Now, how do you

understand Judge Bryson's dissent with respect to cDNA?

I think he's saying that a gene created from -- into

cDNA as a whole is okay, but that he had a problem with

the description of that claim because it included 15

nucleotide long segments or fragments which he says

reoccur in nature.

MR. HANSEN:     Well, and yes, I -- I agree,

Your Honor, that he was focusing on Claims 5 and 6,

which are the ones that include 15 nucleotides or -- or

longer.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:     Now, I'm making your job

harder.     How could they write it to do what he thinks

would be patentable?

MR. HANSEN:     Well, all -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:     So assuming we believe

that there is some human invention in this process,

whether it's obvious or not, separate question.     But

he's not creating -- the cDNA is not in nature

naturally.

So make that assumption.     Make the

assumption that they can make a claim for it.     How do we

avoid his problem?

MR. HANSEN:     Well -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:     I know you are helping

your adversary by answering this question.

MR. HANSEN:     That's fine, Your Honor.     I

think that the -- all of the claims in this case, all

nine claims that we are challenging include both

fragments and the whole gene.     So I don't think there is

anything you can do with respect to these nine claims.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:     I am putting that aside.

MR. HANSEN:     I think by saying that when

genes are transformed in such a way that the scientist

decides their sequence rather than the nature deciding

their sequence -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:     Only if they do a

recombinant DNA, that's what you are saying.

MR. HANSEN:     Right, right.     Now I don't

think cDNA is recombinant DNA, that's what we've argued,

but that's -- that's at least one plausible way of

looking at it.

The genes in this case, the patents on the

genes in this case cover the genes of every man, woman,

and child in the United States.     And as I just said, it

gives the -- the government has given Myriad the

authority to stop research on every one of our genes.

That simply can't be right.

And I would like to make one other point

with respect to Dr. Lander's brief.     On page 16 of Dr.

Lander's brief he discusses specifically that the BRCA

genes appear in the body with covalent bonds in

fragments.     There isn't any real -- there isn't any

scientific dispute about that fact.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:     Why don't you take

another minute.     You weren't afforded an opportunity to

use the time you were reserved.

MR. HANSEN:     Well, I guess the only other

thing I would say then, Your Honor, is to respond to

what I may have left a misimpression with Justice

Kagan's questions.     We agree that you could get a patent

on a use of the leaf that is pulled out of the Amazon or

a plant that is pulled out of the Amazon.     We don't

dispute that.     We don't think you cannot get a patent on

the thing -- the plant itself just because you pulled it

out of the ground and took it to the United States.
